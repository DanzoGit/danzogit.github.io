<p class="h">v2.1.7 (2024-09-30) [FO4 1.10.980+]</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The .esp and .ba2 files have been changed to lowercase filenames. This is to help facilitate universal filename compatibility for Steam Deck and regular linux users whose file systems are case sensitive. Many of them make use of the in-game menu to download mods and Bethesda.net ALWAYS downloads in lowercase. (Bug #34096)</li>
<li>UFO4P had an undocumented change to the X01 Torso Lining C OMOD that has now been removed. (Bug #34188)</li>
<li>Facegen files needed to be generated for EncWorkshopNPCMaleFarmer05 after fixing their duplicate appearace in 26842. (Bug #34378)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Baseball Launcher [ccSBJFO4003_BaseballLauncher] is incorrectly flagged as a VATS Long Burst weapon. The VATSWeaponLongBurst keyword should not have been applied. Removing this fixes several issues with the weapon. (Bug #34038)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Navmesh in POIRJ13 (18,25) [Commonwealth worldspace] was added by the NG update. This navmesh did not take into account edits made by Far Harbor in the same area. This navmesh needed to be refinalized with all of the DLC loaded to ensure it has the correct cell connection data. (Bug #34300)</li>
<li>Vault-Tec Office [VaultTecOfficeExt01] is incorrectly assigned to the West Everett Estates location. It should be assigned to VaultTecOfficeLocation instead. (Bug #34368)</li>
<li>Navmesh in the farmhouse at Abernaty Farm is partially sunken below the floor, preventing the NPCs from navigating it properly. (Bug #34226)</li>
<li>Fort Hagen Satellite Array can't be cleared more than once because the boss NPC does not respawn. The assaultron next to her has been marked as a boss as well. [01007539] (Bug #34210)</li>
<li>The USS Riptide is not clearable because the eastern side of the barge is not included in the USS Riptide location data. (Bug #34168) [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The DLC banners for the Contraptions Workshop are incorrectly sized at 500x1024 instead of 512x1024, which can lead to the game crashing. [textures\interface\DLCBannerDLC05.dds, extures\interface\DLCBannerDLC05grey.dds] (Bug #34251)</li>
<li>The vault door in the Vault-Tec Workshop DLC had a misaligned polygon when the door plays its open animation. [Meshes\DLC06\Architecture\Vault\WorkshopVaultExteriorGearDoor01\WorkshopVaultExteriorGearDoor01.nif] (Bug #34303)</li>
<li>Bus Stop Benches have a pulled vertex on them that creates an unnatural sharp point. Note: This will only address the furniture version of this bench because the static copies are contained in previsbines. [Meshes\Furniture\BusStop\BusStop01.nif] (Bug #33114)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>While "Best of Three" [ccBGSFO4046_BestOfThree] is active, it's possible that the perk which allows you to scan Gunner Pip-Boys will cause Virgil to become hostile during the MQ, which will break it. (Bug #34008)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement and Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Lucy's bed was isolated by a navmesh precut for nearby scrappable items that prevented her from being able to use the bed properly. (Bug #34226)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and Other World Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0017FEA7: Warehouse door which is set to the incorrect variant. (Bug #34318)</li>
<li>085293D9: Fence Post added for unsupported chain link segment. (Bug #34263)</li>
<li>0302F334: Ownership removed from Longfellow's bed to prevent issues with bed assignments for the workshop. (Bug #34227) [PC-Only]</li>
<li>0852D82A: Pipe valves added to cover up exposed 90 degree pipe bend at Big John's Salvage. (Bug #34219)</li>
<li>0006B9F3, 0006B9AF: Beds at Abernathy Farm that cause clipping through the wall when used. (Bug #34226)</li>
<li>0020BC38: Unharvestable Glowing Fungus. (Bug #34111)</li>
<li>00175b63: Floating elevator hatch removed. (Bug #34050)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Text Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC06SecuritySubTerminal01: "DECTECTED" -> "DETECTED" (Bug #34291)</li>
<li>DN088_DeansSubTerminalMail: "They me kept redirecting my call for hours" -> "They kept redirecting my call for hours" (Bug #34277)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.6d (2024-05-14) [FO4 1.10.980+]</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Hangman's Alley to fail to be completed properly due to an unintended edit that removed the Boss flag from one of the raiders.</li>
<li>Generated facegen files for Deidre, MQ302Minuteman02, and DLC04TraderMaleSandbox01. These NPCs all had faulty face morphs corrected in earlier versions but never got updated facegen files.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.6c [a and b skipped due to Nexus upload issues] (2024-04-28) [FO4 1.10.980]</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The fix for DLC03:TrapBear was incomplete and has been corrected.</li>
<li>Merged another script fix in from DLC01MQ00 that needed to be brought in.</li>
<li>Fixed a missed error in one of the Nuka-World cells that would have broken previsbines.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.6 (2024-04-25) [FO4 1.10.980]</p>
<b><u>Official 1.10.980 Patch Update Reconciliation</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Merged change in Heavy Flamer with the position fix for the toolbox so that it will properly require the Keeper's Toolbox Key.</li>
<li>Forwarded the location data added by Enclave Remnants to GlowingSeaPOIJS02.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>workshop_co_SleepMattress is an inaccessible recipe and therefore the edits to it are unnecessary. (Bug #32786)</li>
<li>workshop_co_BedMattress formula has been adjusted to use less steel so that it makes more sense in line with beds that have actual frames. (Bug #33040)</li>
<li>Crashes for users with nVidia RTX cards who attempt to open the Graygarden workshop menu have been resolved. Glitchfinder has provided us with a mesh that eliminates the problem. (Bug #33066) [meshes\Workshop\WorkshopBorderGrayGarden01.nif]</li>
<li>An error in script DLC03:TrapBear causes actors without the Lightfoot perk to fail to properly trigger traps using the script. (Bug #33086)</li>
<li>03043A2D: Rifle that had its placement adjusted at some point but then somehow ended up sitting upright with improper rotation values. (Bug #32959)</li>
<li>Gunslinger level 5 had the weapon checks on the wrong perk entry tab from our fix in UFO4P 1.0.1. (Bug #33846)</li>
<li>The useless Nukalurk Eggs have been removed from the spawning activator. Reverts 27393. The item itself as created by UFO4P will remain to prevent possible CTDs. Go sell the useless eggs or something :P (Bug #33834)</li>
<li>Modified the fix in stage 101 of Reunions [MQ106] so that the Command Center door is not set into a bad state which may then lead to breaking the arrival of the Prydwen. (Bug #33695)</li>
<li>December's Child weight decrease was applied incorrectly resulting in it being heavier instead of lighter as intended. [DLC03_mod_Custom_Weapon_M4] (Bug #33931)</li>
<li>0724DB6F: Fog Condenser added by UFO4P was not linked to its jug. (Bug #32769)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC04_LvlGang_Operator_Boss incorrectly drew from generic raiders which would sometimes result in choosing a Disciple instead of an Operator to fill the template. (Bug #33772)</li>
<li>MQ302Minuteman02 had incorrect face morph values due to being switched from female to male without a proper facegen update. (Bug #33000)</li>
<li>Old Longfellow is missing the ability that controls the Live & Love perks for companions. (Bug #33938)</li>
<li>LCharMoleratLegendary and LCharMoleratAmbushLegendary incorrectly spawn ordinary Mole Rats between level 7 and 13. The Mole Rats themselves also lack their appropriate skins and material swaps. (Bug #33935)</li>
<li>Caged versions of Glowing Mole Rats and Mutant Hounds did not get the fixes that were done for the non-DLC versions. (Bug #33933)</li>
<li>Deathclaws permanently mark a target to dismember on death due to the effect wrongly being set up as an ability. [abDeathClawClawsSpell] (Bug #33920)</li>
<li>Following Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution, the Lookout does not go with his shipmates if the quest ended with the ship crashing into the Baxter Building. [DialogueMS11 - New Alias AI Pack added] (Bug #33139)</li>
<li>After completing "Out of the Fire" [DN121] Saugus Iron Works respawns a leveled raider boss to fill the leader position. This leader should not have been spawning in using Slag's specific version of raider power armor. [LvLForged_Boss] (Bug #32871)</li>
<li>Guard settlers are not using the correct template reference for their inventories. Rather than using EncWorkshopNPCMaleFarmer01Template they should be using EncWorkshopNPCMaleGuard01Template. (Bug #33957)</li>
<li>Synth Refugee [DLC03_Loot_CorpseSynthRefugee] and its female counterpart lack a Synth Component on their bodies, as is found on other dead synths. (Bug #32555)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC03_LL_Armor_Trapper_Coast_Underwear had an invalid form in the list. (Bug #32989)</li>
<li>Fancy Plaid Suit & String Tie [DLC04_Armor_Operators_Underarmor_02] was accidentally left out of the Operators underarmor list. [DLC04_LL_Armor_Operators_Underarmor] (Bug #33849)</li>
<li>DLC01LLI_Vendor_BotMods_Basic_Armor erroneously contains a useless component for Mr Handy Bottom Armor that doesn't have a craftable recipe, nor does it have a craftable modification for it. [miscmod_DLC01Bot_Torso_MrHandy_Armor_Standard_Bottom - removed] (Bug #33848)</li>
<li>DLC04_NukaWorld_Meat75 erroneously offers up Flying Ant Meat which is never used in anything and was apparently cut from the game. (Bug #33847)</li>
<li>MacCreadyOutfit erroneously includes an unplayable set of Road Leathers [Armor_MacCready_Raider_Underarmor] which he cannot use due to his duster conflicting with the biped slot. (Bug #33918)</li>
<li>Basketballs for the Nuka-Cade should cost 4 rubber instead of 2, or the player will be capable of an infinite rubber exploit. [DLC04workshop_co_NukacadeHoopShotBall] (Bug #33842)</li>
<li>Prewar_Locker_01 was missing its open and close sounds. (Bug #33841)</li>
<li>Acid Soaker ammunition only crafts a single round instead of the 20 it was supposed to be. [DLC04_co_Ammo_AcidSoaker] (Bug #33840)</li>
<li>The Gatling Laser Overcharged Capacitor mod incorrectly requires Gun Nut level 2 when energy weapons are always governed by the Science! perks instead. [co_mod_GatlingLaser_LaserReceiver_MoreDamage3] (Bug #33839)</li>
<li>Vault-Tec Deep Pocketed mod has no crafting requirements. [co_mod_armor_VaultTec_Lining_Torso_ImprovedCarryCapacity2] (Bug #33838)</li>
<li>Overboss Power Helm [DLC04_Armor_Power_T51_Helm_RaiderOverboss] is missing the default raider headlamp in its template. (Bug #33836)</li>
<li>MeatBag_Floor001 and MeatBag_Floor002 had wild edits applied by the Wasteland Workshop DLC that serve no purpose. (Bug #33945)</li>
<li>mod_InstituteLaserGun_Scope_ScopeMedium, mod_InstituteLaserGun_Scope_ScopeMedium_NV, and mod_InstituteLaserGun_Scope_ScopeShort_NV are all set to the wrong zoom value for the type of scopes they are. (Bug #33944)</li>
<li>mod_armor_Combat_Lining_Torso_Lighter and DLC03_mod_armor_Marine_Lining_Torso_Lighter should both be providing 5 AP instead of 2 since they are for the torso slot. (Bug #33943)</li>
<li>DLC04_mod_HandmadeGun_Receiver_MoreDamage3 errneously has dn_HasReceiver_Converted applied even though it's not changing the ammo type. (Bug #33942)</li>
<li>DLC04_TrashObjectBurgerbox01, DLC04_TrashObjectCup02, DLC04_TrashObjectCup, DLC04_TrashObjectPizzabox01, DLC04_TrashObjectCupGroup, and DLC04_TrashObjectHotDogbox01 all have abnormally high weight for miscellaneous trash items. (Bug #33941)</li>
<li>holotapeLadiesAux01, holotapeLadiesAux02, holotapeLadiesAux03, holotapeTheControl01, holotapeTheControl02, and holotapeTheControl03 all had a weight of 0.2 when holotapes should have 0 weight. (Bug #33940)</li>
<li>DLC04_Ammo_PaddleBall lacked a short name, causing it to display as blank in the UI. (Bug #33939)</li>
<li>PA_Legendary_Any_Unbreakable, PA_Legendary_Any_Low_Weight, and mod_Legendary_Weapon_RadiationDamage were missing the setting to raise their value by 4x normal. (Bug #33936)</li>
<li>Daytripper should last 10 minutes as its description says instead of 5. (Bug #33932)</li>
<li>Laser Muskets can spawn with Laser Gun parts due to a misconfigured set of object mods. [modcolgroup_LaserMusket_LongBarrel_ExtensionWithBracket_AND_Camera, modcolgroup_LaserMusket_LongBarrel_ExtensionWithBracket_AND_Focuser, modcolgroup_LaserMusket_ShortBarrel_ExtensionWithBracket_AND_Splitter] (Bug #33929)</li>
<li>Poisoned Caltrops should not be setting off explosions when used. [DLC03_ThrowingCaltropWeaponPoisoned] (Bug #33923)</li>
<li>Melee weapon mods do not actually provide bonuses for cripple chance or extra limb damage because the effect data for them was never created. (Bug #33930)</li>
<li>BaseballGrenadeProjectile, BehemothBoulderProjectile, MolotovCocktailProjectile, SynthTeleportGrenadeProjectile, DLC04_LuckyRabbitsFootProjectile, DLC04_LuckyRabbitsFootProjectile2, DLC04NukaCherryGrenadeProjectile, and DLC04NukaQuantumGrenadeProjectile all have explosion effects that incorrectly default to the one for frag grenades. (Bug #33927)</li>
<li>MS09JackRadiationGunProjectile, and GammaGunProjectileLarge are incorrectly flagged to penetrate geometry despite being beam weapons. (Bug #33919)</li>
<li>Robot and Metal armor pieces incorrectly have Universal linking keywords attached to them which results in the "Dense" mod being applicable to more than just torso parts. [Armor_Metal_ArmLeft, Armor_Metal_ArmRight, Armor_Metal_LegLeft, Armor_Metal_LegRight, Armor_Metal_Torso, DLC01_Armor_Robot_Torso, DLC01_Armor_Robot_ArmRight, DLC01_Armor_Robot_ArmLeft, DLC01_Armor_Robot_LegRight, DLC01_Armor_Robot_LegLeft] (Bug #33835)</li>
<li>Deliverer should have the WeaponTypePistol keyword on the actual weapon instead of by way of adding modifications for it. [mod_Deliverer_Grip_Standard, mod_Deliverer_Grip_Better1, mod_Deliverer_Grip_Better2] (Bug #32839)</li>
<li>Fortification effects for Ultra-Jet, Psycho-Jet, and Buffout need to be reduced from 15 duration to 5 duration due to the fact that the durations are incorrectly extended due to the slow time effects. (Bug #32932)</li>
<li>The Marine Armor Chest Piece [DLC03_Armor_Marine_Torso] incorrectly referenced leg armor materials in its Epic variants. (Bug #32809)</li>
<li>Several Rust Devil Robot mods list "Reduces Carry Capacity" as an effect for the object mods. This effect was left off of many of them. See ticket for the complete list. (Bug #31630)</li>
<li>Exemplar's T-60 Torso is always labeled as "c" but it should be "b", "d", or "e" based on which level is rewarded to you by Kells. (Bug #31517)</li>
<li>Plasma weapons should now work properly with the Penetrator perk. [PlasmaProjectileLarge, PlasmaProjectileSmall, PlasmaProjectileSmallFast, DLC01LightningGunProjectile] (Bug #23322)</li>
<li>Curie will now give Curie's Healthpaks to the player instead of ordinary stimpaks. Curie's Healthpak [ALCH 0019c0d9] does exist in the game files already, but it was nowhere used (Bug #32937)</li>
<li>The combat rifle mods mod_CombatRifle_Scope_SightsImprovedGlowIron and mod_CombatRifle_Scope_SightsImprovedIron were using the same loose mod. The combat shotgun mods mod_CombatShotgun_Scope_SightsImprovedGlow and mod_CombatShotgun_Scope_SightsImprovedIron had the same problem. Two new loose mods were created and have also been added to all relevant leveled lists and form lists. (Bug #32641)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Several issues with the setup for the Caravan encounter in Automatron have been corrected. (Bug #33074)</li>
<li>MassPikeInterchangeExt03 had a Nuka-Cola machine with navmesh under it that should not have been there. The navmesh has been adjusted to account for the machine being in the way. (Bug #32858)</li>
<li>The Walden Pond Gift Shop Basement [WaldenPond01] was missing the "Has Water" flag. (Bug #33816)</li>
<li>Fixed an elevated navmesh vertex at the back entrance to Hardware Town. (Bug #32812)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Plasma Guns, Laser Guns, Laser Muskets, and Lever-Action Rifle all have an unnecessary generic collision block around them which makes it place awkwardly in several situations as well as having the wrong material sounds attached. (Bug #33064) [Meshes/Weapons/HuntingRifle/HuntingRifleDummyParent.nif, Meshes/Weapons/LaserMusket/LaserMusketDummyReceiver.nif, Meshes/Weapons/LaserWeapons/LaserWeaponDummyReceiver.nif, Meshes/Weapons/Plasma/DummyReceiver.nif]</li>
<li>Warehouse roof piece with a transparent ceiling. [Materials\Architecture\Warehouse\WrhsRoofPlywood01.bgsm] (Bug #33191)</li>
<li>The bounding boxes on 3 workbenches and one trash bin have been corrected so that parts of them no longer disappear at certain angles. Fix provided by Pra. [meshes\furniture\workstations\workbencharmor\WorkstationArmorB01.nif, meshes\furniture\workstations\workbenchweapons\WorkbenchWeaponsB.nif, meshes\furniture\workstations\workbenchweapons\WorkbenchWeaponsA.nif, meshes\setdressing\trashbin\TrashBin01.nif] (Bug #32894)</li>
<li>Assaultron Claw Hands do not have a material flie specified. The material file that should be used also has the incorrect grayscale texture set. [meshes\Actors\Robot\Parts\HandLeftAssaultronClaw.nif, meshes\Actors\Robot\Parts\HandRightAssaultronClaw.nif, Materials\DLC01\Actors\CreateABot\DLC01AssaultronBladeHandsRemap_base.bgsm] (Bug #29367)</li>
<li>Nuka-World Assaultron space paint material references the wrong normal map. [materials\Actors\DLC04\BotColors\DLC04AssaultronTorso.BGSM] (Bug #29367)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>SentryBotFaceLightScript: Removed the IsBoundGameObjectAvailable() check in the OnEffectFinish block of the script as this appears to cause an issue with the light remaining on even though the game throws a Papyrus error. (Bug #25355)</li>
<li>Default2StateActivatorScript: A few edits were made to this script as part of the fixes related to various doors in Fort Hagen: the handling of disabled references was improved and redundant code has been removed. (Bug #33695)</li>
<li>SpotlightScript: This script was missing code for handling the light sources of spotlights that are initially disabled. (Bug #32995)</li>
<li>UFOActivatorScript: Added a sanity check for invalid sound instances. (Bug #32545)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: The top level vendor globals were not properly updated when a top level vendor store was removed from a workshop. (Bug #32686)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Bloodied perk [ModLegendaryWeaponsDamageInverseHealthPerk] has errors in how it checks the conditions for the player's health. (Bug #33851)</li>
<li>RRTheHeavyPerk and ImmuneToRadiation should both be hidden due to having no UI elements to show the player. (Bug #33850)</li>
<li>The bonus application for Black Widow and Lady Killer were inverted. The global properties should be negative values due to how the actual formula calculation is done. (Bug #33843)</li>
<li>Endangerol Syringes do not actually work the way the game describes, instead causing the target to reduce the effectiveness of everyone else's armor. To mimic the intent, the perk associated with the item now does 25% extra damage to the target. Text descriptions have been changed to reflect this as well. [EndangerolPerk] (Bug #33845)</li>
<li>Energy Weapons Bobblehead does not affect Gatling Lasers and Alien Blasters. [PerkBobbleheadEnergyWeapons] (Bug #33934)</li>
<li>The Rad Powered legendary perk has a messy implementation that would result in showing multiple individual strength buffs in the UI instead of a single one with the correct buff amount. [DLC03_ench_mod_Legendary_Armor_RadsIncreaseStrength] (Bug #33928)</li>
<li>Calmex incorrectly blocks its effect if the player has Ninja level 2 despite the chem and the perk having nothing to do with each other. [FortifySneakAttackBonus2xChemPerk] (Bug #33926)</li>
<li>Repair Bobblehead has an unnecessary check for whether the player is wearing Power Armor or not. [PerkBobbleheadRepair] (Bug #33925)</li>
<li>Quiet Reflection is missing it's UI animation. [QuietReflectionXPBonus] (Bug #33924)</li>
<li>Pain Train 3 does not actually improve impact landing damage due to the effect not being assigned. [PA_ImpactLandingAggroDamageSpell] (Bug #33922)</li>
<li>Sniper level 1 has an unnecessary condition check for Iron Sights which causes a stutter when aiming the weapon. [PerkSniperAimStability] (Bug #33921)</li>
<li>Sneak level 5 is not applying its invisibility component properly for distant enemies. [PerkSneakInvisibilityEffect, PerkSneakInvisibility] (Bug #32931)</li>
<li>Mister Sandman needed to have its perk priority adjusted to prevent it interfering with sneak attack value bonuses from Ninja and Cloak & Dagger. (Bug #31307)</li>
<li>The Piezonucleic Lining mod for Power Armor does not do what the description says. An actual perk to produce the proper effect did not exist and had to be created for it. [ench_mod_LegendaryPA_RadsCoreHealth -> changed from using LegendaryPA_RadsCoreHealthEffect to UFO4P_PiezonucleicEffect] (Bug #22529)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Curie's pick up lines were not flagged to require player activation and would instead be pulled as random dialogue you could not avoid. (Bug #32908)</li>
<li>When asked to tell stories for the class in Vault 81 [Short Stories - V81_04] Katy's dialogue references completing MQ102 instead of Min00. The story you tell is about killing the deathclaw, which happens in Min00. (Bug #21305)</li>
<li>"Object01 - Radio in a junk pile" [REObjectDL01] incorrectly marks 2 of the spawned objects as temporary. This leaves the rest hovering above the ground when the player returns later. The "garbage pile" object will also throw visual anomalies because the script is trying to move a static object during setup. (Bug #33585) [NR]</li>
<li>The random encounter for Dreth could become broken and leave the player unable to trade with her again on subsequent meetings. (Bug #25994)</li>
<li>The random encounter with Stash could end up broken because her forcegreet was flagged as Say Once. (Bug #26734)</li>
<li>Technical Documents, Viable Blood Sample, and Reactor Coolant [currently unused] will no longer get spawned if the player has become hostile with the Brotherhood of Steel. (Bug #33091)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement and Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Egret Tours Marina, Outpost Zimonja, and Taffington Boathouse could have attack markers moved to where the player wanted a fast travel marker. This could result in attacking NPCs being right on top of the settlement instead of at the designated edges. A new marker has been placed in each location, linked to the map marker, and then positioned to where the edge marker is currently at since the edge marker is what would be used for the FT target. The edge markers are then relocated back to their default positions in the CK. (Bug #33906)</li>
<li>Hangman's Alley could pick up the wrong map marker for the Workshop data. (Bug #33871)</li>
<li>Power Armor stations should no longer cause Encumbrance damage when using them in survival mode. [HC_EncumbranceEffect_OverEncumbered] (Bug #33844)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and Other World Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0100FFA9, 0100FFAA: Eyebots generating static when disabled. Fixed by attaching a new script provided by Glitchfinder. (Bug #33776)</li>
<li>000ED0DD: Locker clipping through plumbing. (Bug #33143)</li>
<li>000ED126: Desk clipping through wall column. (Bug #33143)</li>

<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Due to ongoing issues with the Far Harbor DLC, all worldspace edits (except the persistent records) have been removed from the XBox One copy of the mod. Until such time as the exact cause of the problems can be pinned down, this will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Please note that this is NOT because the patch had errors. It's because the master DLC file on XB1 is not the same one we have to build against on PC. There are mismatched cell headers which cause both previsbine errors and potential CTDs at semi-random locations. It's not the solution we would have preferred, but too many people are spending too much time in a blind black box to justify continuing without at least temporarily putting a stop to the problems. When ( or perhaps if ) we are able to figure out exactly which edits to remove, we'll reinstate the full copy and then remove only those parts.<br><br>This problem is not limited to the UFO4P either. ANY mod which makes edits to the main island worldspace will also run into these problems on XB1. This is a mismatch at Bethesda's level and only they can fix it permanently.

<li>Once more unto the breech! Glowing Mutant Hounds STILL had a broken texture on XBox One because the archiving tool when used on its own does NOT perform the proper texture conversions. Only the CK will do this, and it had to be convinced through some janky methods to not only convert the glow map, but also to archive and upload the results. In the end, it's now fixed, and let's hope this time for good. (Bug #33014) [XBox Only - PC not affected]

<ul>
<li>The glow map texture for the glowing mutant hounds got corrupted again somehow. It has been fixed yet again. Hopefully for good this time. (textures\actors\FEVHound\FEVHound_g.dds)</li>
<li>The Graygarden workshop borders that were initially fixed in 23169 have been reverted and replaced with a direct mesh edit to properly indicate the borders instead. (meshes\Workshop\WorkshopBorderGrayGarden01.nif) (Bug #32583)</li>
<li>The edit for debris material needs to be removed because the affected file is in use by more than just the previously known references. Reverts Bug #32322 and deletes the material file in Materials\Landscape\Ground\DebrisGroundTile.BGSM (Bug #32691)</li>
<li>Several cells on Far Harbor end up with missing textures on XB1 due to a mismatch in the data sets for Previsbines in them. It doesn't matter what type of edits they were since the issue lies in the CELL record headers themselves. [AcadiaObservatoryExt02, FringeCoveDocksExt02, HarborGrandHotelExt03, NationalParkCampgroundExt, SouthWestHarborExt, DLC03POIDL02, DLC03POI14, DLC03POI55, DLC03POI02] (Bug #31597)</li>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Amelia Stockton incorrectly had a synth component in her inventory that is instead supposed to be an on-death item. (Bug 32704)</li>
<li>Female "Child of Atom" corpses only identified as a generic corpse rather than one specific to them. This was due to mistakenly inheriting the base data from generic corpses. [Loot_CorpseChildrenOfAtomFemale] (Bug #32791)</li>
<li>Bullet's Minions remain gathered outside of Billy's house after the end of his quest because their package conditions would only make them follow Bullet as long as it was running. Since these minions only exist to support Bullet anyway, all conditions from the package have been removed. So where Bullet goes, his goons will follow. [MS01BulletMinionFollow] (Bug #19998)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Seasoned Rabbit Skewers were missing a piece of wood in its recipe. All other skewered food requires one. [DLC03_co_food_SteakRabbit] (Bug #32739)</li>
<li>Vendor counters at Bunker Hill could be destroyed during the battle because the furniture objects had destruction data attached. Once destroyed, the vendors can no longer do their jobs and can't be reassigned either. Unfortunately the objects will not regenerate if they're already destroyed. [WorkshopStoreMisc03NoEditDinerCounter] (Bug #32727) [NR]</li>
<li>The Relentless modification had a NULL enchantment in its list. [mod_Legendary_Weapon_OnCritRefillAP] (Bug #32708)</li>
<li>Empty Lukowski's Potted Meat Trays should have been set up as Aluminum rather than steel. (Bug #32684)</li>
<li>The Workshop hamper was incorrectly set up to require wood scrap instead of the normal wood component. [DLC06Workshop_co_CleanFurn_Hamper_Empty] (Bug #32680)</li>
<li>LLM_HuntingRifle and LL_MiscMod_HuntingRifle had entries in their lists which should have been set to level 11 but were mistakenly set for level 111. (Bug #32672)</li>
<li>Nuka-Cide [DLC04_NukaCola_NukaCide] should provide a larger magnitude when the player has the Wasteland Survival 3 perk. The value checks on this were reversed. The boosted magnitude was also incorrectly set to 10 when it should be 11.25. (Bug #32671)</li>
<li>The Calibrated Powerful Receiver mod incorrectly references the scope attachment point instead of the gun casing attachment point. [mod_DoubleBarrelShotgun_Receiver_MoreDamage2_and_BetterCriticals] (Bug #32778)</li>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Rite of Passage (DLC03FarHarborM01) does not recognize meats added by Nuka-World. All of the DLC04 meats have been added to formlist DLC03FarHarborM01MeatList so that they will be usable in the quest. (Bug #32763)</li>
<li>Strong's affinity dialogue checks were all incorrectly keyed to the player and would always respond neutral. Further, all of the random lead-in dialogue was set to check Admiration rather than Infatuation, resulting in only 4 sets of choices instead of 5 like it should be. And to top all of that off, none of his responses were properly randomized so only the first response in each set was ever used. [COMStrongTalk] (Bug #32699)</li>
<li>Cedric Hopton should be set as protected after losing his essential status in Building a Better Crop (InstM01) so that he doesn't randomly die and improperly get the player blamed for his murder. (Bug #32690)</li>
<li>During Hunter/Hunted (MQ205) the radio signal that lead you to the Courser should have been shut down. A property was missing on Z2-47's quest alias to call the stage that handled this. (Bug #32569)</li>
<li>Pest Control, Hypothesis, Appropriation, Reclamation, and Political Leanings [InstR01, InstR02, InstR03NEW, InstR04, InstR05] could all be erroneously restarted after the player is kicked out of the Institute (or later destroys it) because the Story Management node was only checking to see if Synth Retention [Inst301] had been completed rather than also checking to see if the kickout conditions had been set. (Bug #32570)</li>
<li>In Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution [MS11], telling the scavengers you'll help them prompts Cait to say she liked the decision, yet she throws a negative affinity bump. This is caused by CompanionAffinityEventQuestScript calling the wrong affinity function for her response event. (Bug #32389) [NR]</li>
<li>In the same quest, Strong incorrectly gives a neutral bump instead of a negative bump when telling the scavengers you're siding with Ironsides. (Bug #32389) [NR]</li>
<li>The scientist who scans you for radiation at Vault 81 could never play his lines because they were all checking if he had the radiation amounts instead of the player. One response line was also incorrectly configured to only play for male characters even though it's a neutral line. (Bug #32803)</li>
<li>During Road To Freedom [RR101], Deacon has some dialogue to vouch for the player when certain quests are done. If the player rescues Nick Valentine from Skinny Malone, Deacon's lines for this can't play because they're checking the wrong quest stage. (Bug #32802)</li>
<li>Getting the final reward from Kent Connolly in The Silver Shroud [MS04] when you're at level 45 or higher makes you wait for an arbitrarily long time (until level 100). This is due to the fact that the armor is given to you based on Kent's level instead of your own. He's level 6, so the armor is the lowest one on the table. Given the scripting involved it's fairly clear this was supposed to give you the armor based on your own level, and if you were already at or above 45, to set it up so that no upgrades would be offered since none are available beyond that. Note that if you've already completed this quest you'll just have to play on to level 100 to get the appropriate copy since there's no way to determine what level you were when the quest was completed. (Bug #32783) [NR]</li>
<li>At the end of Taken For A Ride [DLC04MQ01] the player is supposed to gain "ownership" of the Fizztop Grille, but this is never done. The end result being that the bed will not confer the benefits of the Well Rested or Lover's Embrace perks when slept in. (Bug #28846)</li>
<li>During The Battle of Bunker Hill [Inst302], if the player kills 2 or frees 1 synth, the objective to deal with escaped synths is deactivated. However, further along in the quest when the player needs to report back to the Institute, the quest reinstates the objective when it shouldn't. Not only should it ignore this condition, it would also result in a duplicated objective in the quest list. (Bug #25914)</li>
<li>After Open Season [DLC04RaiderKickout] there may be several dead raiders who remain behind indefinitely. This appears to be because several Actor Dialogue event quests could be running at the same time you're running around killing them all. These quests will all be shut down now once you've completed Open Season and should result in the raider corpses despawning after the expected amount of time. (Bug #22242)</li>
<li>Similarly, after destroying the Railroad by killing all of its NPCs, none of the corpses ever get cleaned up because numerous quests are still running which are holding them in aliases. These will all be shut down upon reloading the game a second time after installing the patch. This should allow for time to go loot the bodies before the cleanup is triggered. (Bug #20003)</li>
<li>Radio Freedom should no longer exhibit janky behavior like going silent after moving around, and should now work properly when placed Minutemen Radio objects are turned on. This was due to an odd set of conditions on the radio loop scene that would interrupt things if the player was not tuned in on the pip-boy or listening live at The Castle. (Bug #20522)</li>
<li>In Pull the Plug [DN138] the second objective to return to Sulley is never completed and remains open in your pip-boy forever. (Bug #25186)</li>

<li>Tarberry normally gives 1hp/sec for 10 seconds. Reading Wasteland Survival Guide #1 should boost that to 1.5hp/sec for 10 seconds but it was mistakenly set to a 5 second duration. (Bug #31743)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Several navmesh nodes were buried underground at Finch Farm, causing Jack to get stuck and end up teleporting. (Bug #25288)</li>
<li>Four random wilderness cells [-7,21 / -7,22 / -8,21 / -8,22 ] were erroneously marked as being part of GeneralAtomicsGalleriaLocation when they're nowhere near that site. They should all have been in the default CommonwealthLocation instead. (Bug #31494)</li>
<li>Several locations in the Commonwealth incorrectly had dungeon music assigned which starts playing even when you're still outside the buildings and should still be hearing exploration music. All of the cells in these locations correctly have dungeon music assigned internally so they will not lose the proper music. (Bug #31476)</li>
<li>Cell 4,1 (near Bunker Hill, on the river) is mistakenly marked to disable water LOD. (Bug #31732)</li>
<li>Minor navmesh issues at Huntress Island that may have prevented enemies from entering one of the houses. A ramp [0738F5B5] has also been added to the back door as there was a significant gap between the doorway and the landscape outside that was large enough to impede the player as well. (Bug #32329)</li>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Several lights added by the Vault-Tec Workshop DLC cast their shadows and light cones in the wrong direction due to their light emmision nodes being in the wrong positions.

<li>Due to a missing double sided flag on the material, roof sections on top of things like the bus stop at Shaw High School had invisible bottoms. [Materials\Architecture\Buildings\hightech\HitTechGlassExterior01NA.BGSM] (Bug #31804)</li>
<li>The Carlisle Typewriter variant had flat keys with no 3D definition on them like the common junk typewriter. [meshes\props\typewriter\typewriter.nif] (Bug #31671)</li>
<li><s>Debris piles have transparent holes in them where they don't belong due to a bad alpha setting on their material file. [Materials\Landscape\Ground\DebrisGroundTile.BGSM] (Bug #32322)</s> [UFO4P 2.1.5]</li>
<li>The normal map for the Memory Lounger does not display because of a bad texture path in the material file. [Materials\SetDressing\MemoryLounge\MemoryLoungerGlass01.BGEM] (Bug #32064)</li>
<li>BeachFence_BrokenEnd_Left01, which is used in 52 places in the game, has no geometry within the mesh. This results in phantom collision being present. All of the blocks have been removed from the mesh to resolve the issue. [meshes\SetDressing\FencesGrates\BeachFence_BrokenEnd_Left01.nif] (Bug #32356)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Eleanor's Friendship gives out discounts globally instead of only with her as it was supposed to. (Bug #31345)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The WRVR Radio NPCs should no longer repeat the scene about Rex being held by Super Mutants if Curtain Call (MS10b) is already completed. There was no condition on the intro scene preventing it from being run again. (Bug #24025)</li>
<li>As part of Ad Victoriam [BoS304, by way of DNPrime_BoS304] several waves of Synths are enabled for the battle at the CIT Courtyard. Once the fight is over, the alias that handles the 5th wave is never disabled again like the other 4. This eventually results in new Synths spawning over the destroyed remains of the Institute and they all fall into the water below. To fix this, Stage 1000 of DNPrime_BoS304 has an added line to disable the 5th wave alias markers. (Bug #21288)</li>
<li>In The Sight [MQ00MamaMurphy] when the player gives drugs to Mama Murhphy, they are never taken from the player's inventory. (Bug #21567)</li>
<li>Getting kicked out of the Railroad is supposed to let you then kill all of its leaders. This could not be accomplished because the scripts for the quest mixed the usage of the SetEssential() function between Actor references and base actor records. The CK wiki specifically says that once SetEssential() is called on an individual Actor reference, further attempts to call this function on the base actor will be ignored. This results in the leaders still being flagged essential when they should not be. (Bug #21552)</li>
<li>Randolph Safehouse [RRR06] can sometimes give you an objective with a truncated location name. This appears to be causes by alias depencencies being out of order, with the final forced alias that <i>should</i> be getting used ending up not filled. This alias for the actual location was also marked optional, which would throw things off and is possibly the cause of several other bugs relating to this quest as well. The alias has been repositioned in the list as seen in the CK, and marked as required now. This should stop this quest from coming up at all if an invalid location is rolled. (Bug #23158)</li>
<li>Jackpot [RRR03] also suffers from the exact same problem. The alias processing order is wrong and the chosen location can end up invalid, which may well result in being sent back to the same place that was just visited. The same solution was implemented and the optional flag removed from the alias that holds the actual location. So now this quest will not run if no valid location can be found either. (Bug #20551)</li>
<li>At the end of Star Control [DLC04GZMainQuest] when the zone is cleared several robot modifications are unlocked, except for the Auto Space Lasers. This was due to a missing call to enable the global that controls the recipes for the 4 varieties. (Bug #23884)</li>
<li>Dr. Li will not respond to the Progress Report topic if you have been appointed director but the reactor is not yet online. This is due to the response checking for an incorrect quest stage. (Bug #23837)</li>
<li>When encountering the scavangers at Rotting Landfill they will remain stuck at the site if the player never talked to them after the fight. AI pack DN119TravelToDiamondCity needed to be adjusted to send them to Diamond City whenever DN119Fight is no longer running. This will cover any condition in which the quest can be terminated. (Bug #28538)</li>
<li>The corpses for Josh and Emma at the Super Duper Mart need the quest object flag set on their aliases in DN068 so that they will not be culled by the game before the player has a chance to take their holotapes. (Bug #31473)</li>
<li>The Atom Cats Garage drag race scene should no longer be triggered and over with before the player can get close enough to watch. (Bug #32515)</li>
<li>Weathervane [RRR05] does not give out all 11 possible drop locations because the global variable that determines if you placed all of them was set to 9 instead of 11 [RRR05MILAsAllPlaced]. (Bug #31562) [NR]</li>
<li>When picking up Curie, dialgoue she's supposed to use as a synth cannot be played when you're dropping someone else off because the lines are all conditioned to use the wrong value for the ComCurieIsSynth global variable. Several other non-pickup related lines also used the same incorrect condition checks and have also been fixed. (Bug #32397)</li>
<li>When dropping Preston off and picking up Codswoth as a companion, Preston's line for female players does not play because it is incorrectly checking for male players. (Bug #32395)</li>
<li>Ok, let's just get this over with and check all the rest - several other companions also had the same issue as reported for Strong and Hancock. The dialogue was mistakenly set to targer, not quest alias. (Bug #32393, 32394)</li>
<li>When talking to Moe about baseball, Strong and Hancock have responses that don't play due to checking the wrong status variables. (Bug #32542)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>BoS100FightMonitor: Fixed several issues with the AllGhouls array caused by engine bugs relating to the use of the PlaceAtMe function. This should eliminate recurring errors in the log and cuts off one avenue for engine issues to cause this script to remove objects that aren't even Ghouls at all. (Bug #28303)</li>
<li>During Taken For A Ride, the player is tasked with defeating Colter in a combat area. As part of this, it is possible to sabotage his protection by removing a fusion core from one of the nearby reactors. Due to an issue with floating point calculations, the DLC04:DLC04MQ01GauntletQuestScript would make it nearly impossible to zap Coulter with the water pistol. A very slight adjustment on the value used (from 0.0004 to 0.00039 - yes, this actually does work) corrects the problem and allows the weakness to be exploited as intended. (Bug #28142)</li>
<li>MQ206QuestScript: Lack of sanity checking on the Shutters alias - the function can be called from outside MQ207 even when it's not running yet. (Bug #25410)</li>
<li>V111BedScript: Incorrect quest stage being checked if the player activates a bed after leaving Vault 111 and then returning later. (Bug #25278)</li>
<li>QF_MQ302_000229EE: During The Nuclear Option [MQ302] This script is supposed to run a teleport effect on the faction leader you bring with you on the assault. That script was never placed, so the teleport call always fails. It's been disabled to supress the error. This will not break the actual sequence where the NPC comes in and later leaves with you. (Bug #26183)</li>
<li>QF_DN136_Attack_00121D0C: No sanity check on the Z114 alias - the NPC is optional but the script doesn't treat it as such. (Bug #26174)</li>
<li>QF_DN028_PAsystem_0018E378: Removed a redundant call to start the PA System scene since the scene itself is configured to star when the quest does via the checkbox in the scene data. (Bug #26484)</li>
<li>vaultExitElevatorSCRIPT: When exiting chargen, the Looks menu event is never unregistered. (Bug #29292)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement and Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The cell immediately to the south of Taffington Boathouse (1,10) was not marked as part of the location which prevented most settlement functions from behaving correctly if things were built on it. (Bug #31714)</li>
<li><s>Graygarden has a buildable area which extends upward to part of the overpass on the south side. However, the workshop buildable border indicator does not extend up far enough to be visible from either level of the overpass. A new pair of border indicators has been added to show this when you're up there. [Added resource: meshes\UFO4P\Workshop\WorkshopBorderGraygarden01_10x2UFO4P.nif. Static record added: 07001FFF.

<p class="h">v2.1.3 (2021-05-22) [FO4 1.10.163]</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Due to an oversight in the quest scripts modified for bug #28982, unique items that are placed directly in the game world (i.e. not in an actor's inventory or otherwise in a container) could be missing entirely when a new game was started with UFO4P 2.1.2b installed. This bug affected four items in the base game, one item in the Far Harbor DLC and one item in the Nuka-World DLC. The fix makes sure that all missing items are recreated. You will be able to pick them up at their usual places (Bug #30815).</li>
</ul>
   
<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DN083_EncTurretTripodMounted: The template used by Barney's turrets was changed from EncTurretTripodMounted01Template to EncTurretTripodMounted04 (which brings them from level 1 to level 40), since the encounter zone they're in has a minimum level of 45 where level 1 turrets were almost instantly destroyed by the mirelurks they were supposed to defeat (Bug #24584).</li>
<li>EncRadscorpion04Legendary, EncRadscorpion04AmbushLegendary: Legendary albino radscorpions were missing the material swaps for the albino skin (Bug #26401).</li>
<li>LvlRadRoachNOSCALE: Due to a mistake with templates, the names of this variant of radroaches (with a fixed size) did not always match their appearance, i.e. normal radroaches were occasionally named glowing radroaches and vice versa (Bug #19884).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Audio Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>One of the settler voice recordings in a topic in ConvBunkerHillDebGenericNPC02 didn't match the other recordings or the subtitle. (Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\FemaleEvenToned\0005FB8C_1.fuz) (Bug #29509)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-Jet: Despite its description stating an action point increase for 15s, this effect only lasted for 5s (Bug #30623).</li>
<li>DLC04_Armor_Power_T51_Torso_RaiderOverboss: The overboss power armor torso was missing a null mod in the Misc slot (Bug #29223).</li>
<li>CO_Mod_GatlingLaser_LaserReceiver_MoreDamage2: The construction of the Gatling Laser's Maximized Capacitor mod required the same science perk level as the construction of the Overcharged Capacitor mod, but should have required one level less (Bug #29496).</li>
<li>FSTArmorMechanistWalkLImpactSet, FSTArmorMechanistWalkRImpactSet: The entries for walking in water in the impact data sets for the mechanist's armor were pointing to the impact data for power armor instead of the corresponding data for the mechanist's armor (Bug #29302).</li>
<li>PowerRelayCoil: Removed a script that tried to set an obsolete stage on MS11 every time a power relay coil was dropped, picked up or moved between containers (Bug #23500).</li>
<li>ModCol_PipeRevolver_Barrels_Long: The collection of long barrel mods for the pipe revolver mistakenly contained the long finned barrel mod for pipe bolt action guns (Mod_PipeBoltAction_Barrel_FinnedLong) instead of the corresponding pipe revolver mod (Mod_PipeRevolver_Barrel_FinnedLong) (Bug #29781).</li>
<li>PA_X01_Torso_Lining_C: While all other third level power armor torso linings in the game add 120 HP, this one did only add 60 HP. This is no improvement compared to the corresponding second level mod (PA_X01_Torso_Lining_B), which adds 60 HP too, and thus unlikely to have been intended (Bug #29217).</li>
<li>DLC03_Mod_Armor_Marine_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, DLC03_Mod_Armor_Trapper_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, DLC04_Mod_Armor_Disciples_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, DLC04_Mod_Armor_Operators_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, DLC04_Mod_Armor_Pack_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection and Mod_Armor_RaiderMod_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection all appear in mod collections for both arm and leg armor pieces and thus could be found on epic arm and leg armor items created by the game at run time. Though, once removed from arm pieces, the mods could not be put back nor mounted on other arm pieces because of an inappropriate mod association keyword (Bug #30341).</li>
<li>DLC03_mod_armor_Trapper_Lining_Torso_Lighter3: This mod did mistakenly show up in the workbench menu for raider torsos, due to a wrong mod association keyword. Since it's a perfect duplicate of DLC03_mod_armor_Trapper_Lining_Torso_Lighter2 and also does not have a valid construction recipe (no materials specified), it has been invalidated (Bug #29782)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>HalluciGen, Inc.: Added a drop down marker to a ledge that didn't have one. Companions had to take a lengthy detour because they could not follow the player when he jumped down from that ledge (Bug #20418).</li>
<li>Forest Grove Marsh: A one triangle navmesh island in a corner between a car frame and a container on the bridge just south of Forest Grove Marsh (cell -15,-6) has been moved out of the way since NPCs could get stuck there. On rare occasions, this could happen to Dogmeat during the quest MQ106 (Reunions) (Bug #19579).</li>
<li>Somerville Place: The navmesh inside of the small bunker north of Somerville Place had no connection to the navmesh outside of it (Bug #28589).</li>
</ul>
   
<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Inst302: This quest never disabled all of the BoS soldiers that were enabled for the battle of Bunker Hill because some of them are not enable-parented and are enabled by scripts on various triggers instead. Because only those triggers can access them directly (through their links), they should also disable them eventually. To fix this, a cleanup function has been added to BHExtBoSEnable, along with some code that lets the script react to a custom cleanup event, and a custom script to send this event has been added to Inst302 (Bug #26704).</li>
<li>RETravelCT07 (Simon attacks; Stash & Co, pt4): A tracking global was added to stop the story manager from trying to repeat this encounter after Simon is dead. The quest itself could not restart with Simon dead, but could get stuck in its startup phase and would then block its trigger forever (Bug #30279).</li>
<li>DN009_MQ305 (Hunter/Hunted): At high levels, the scenes between the courser and the gunners could break because the courser was no longer able to kill his captives as intended. To avoid this, the quest script will now give him a custom perk that allows him to deal extra damage to his captives (Bug #29458).</li>
<li>DialogueCovenant: Jacob Orden would still warn the player about Honest Dan even after MS17 (Human Error) was completed, because the respective topic had no appropriate checks to avoid this (Bug #28457). Also, Swanson's taunt line should only ever be used when he's targeting the player, but the respective topic had no appropriate checks either (Bug #28683).</li>
<li>ComCurie, ComDeacon, ComStrong: Curie, Deacon and Strong will no longer comment on robots, synths, and turrets looted by the player as if they were beings of flesh and blood. In addition to adding condition checks to various dialogue topics, this fix also required substantial modifications to CA_QuestScript and the quest CA_LootCorpse, as there would otherwise have been no target to run the checks on (Bug #23400).</li>
<li>Inst302: The railroad agents enabled in the exterior world space during the battle of Bunker Hill were never disabled. While they do not respawn, any agent who survived the battle could stay in the area infinitely (Bug #30482).</li>
<li>REChokepointCT02 (Stash & Co, pt1): Due to setting a tracking bool prematurely, this encounter could be missed entirely. The game would then proceed with starting the second part of this encounter series, where NPCs would talk to the player as if they had met before. Also, due to the quest shutting down and the aliases being cleared while the end stage fragment was still running, it could fail to move the NPCs back to the holding cell (Bug #29465).</li>
<li>RETravelCT06 (Stash & Co, pt2): This quest was supposed to set a control stage and a tracking bool when the NPCs turn hostile, but this never happened because the scripts on its aliases were missing a property. This could result in the game trying to repeat this encounter or to proceed with follow-up quests in this encounter series (depending on whether the player spoke to Stash or not, and on his dialogue choices) even after all actors were dead. Also, due to the quest shutting down and the aliases being cleared while the end stage fragment was still running, it could fail to move the NPCs back to the holding cell (Bug #30228).</li>
<li>RECampCT07a (Stash & Lexa dead; Stash & Co, pt3): Due to setting a tracking bool prematurely, this encounter could be missed entirely. The game would then proceed with starting RETravelCT07 eventually, and the player would miss a part of the story because he never witnessed the camp scene. This quest will now stay running until the player gets close enough to the camp site to discover the corpses and only then will set its tracking bool and be allowed to shut down (Bug #30278).</li>
<li>DLC01MQ01 (Mechanical Menace): Ada's combat behavior flag on the scene DLC01MQ01_2400_AdaIntro was flipped from "end" to "pause", in order to allow her for resuming the conversation in case it gets interrupted by a stray enemy (Bug #28935).</li>
<li>Deezer (Covenant) will now eventually be disabled when he's dead (Bug #25953).</li>
<li>Knight Lucia (Boston Airport) will now eventually be disabled when she's dead (Bug #26818).</li>
<li>BoSEnable: The BoS scribes enabled by BoS301 (Liberty Reprimed) were never disabled after the Prydwen had crashed. This will be handled now by the stage 200 fragment of BoSEnable (Bug #26818).</li>
<li>DialogueGoodneighborRufus (Trouble Brewin'): This quest should not fail all of its objectives if Rufus dies after the drinkin' buddy has been delivered to him (Bug #24872).</li>
<li>DLC04WorkshopBOSAttack01, DLC04WorkshopBOSAttack02, DLC04WorkshopBOSAttack03: These quests did never shut down, because they forgot to flip a bool property on their REScript once they got to the stage where shutting down was safe (Bug #28959).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad: This script had to be modified to handle cases where objects are placed on other objects that can be disabled or otherwise removed, such as knifes placed on corpses: when the corpse was cleaned up by the game eventually, it left the knife floating in mid air. The fix was then applied to a knife (001A6968) held by a settler corpse (Bug #26817).</li>
</ul>
   
<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The "highlight living targets" effect (DetectLifeChem) from Berry Mentats didn't benefit from the Chemist Perk because it was missing the necessary keyword (ChemEffect). (Bug #29095)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement & Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Outpost Zimonja: Fixed various navmesh issues related to gaps, precut meshes and overlapping triangles. To ease the reconstruction of its precut mesh, the cooking pot 0007285F was slightly moved away from a fence (Bug #30444).</li>
<li>Jamaica Plain: Fixed a navmesh gap, grounded two significantly floating navmesh vertices and added a missing precut mesh to the news stand 00095383 (Bug #29901).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>BoS301ScaraMainTerminal: Due to a missing condition check, an entry on Professor Scara's terminal about the arrival of the Prydwen could be read before the Prydwen actually arrived (Bug #23252).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and Other World Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0019D9E2: Floating bobby pin box (Bug #30553).</li>
<li>000E9277: Enable marker missing an 'initially disabled' flag (Bug #30814).</li>
<li>00072807: Cinder blocks clipping into a guard tower (Bug #30444).</li>
<li>00024A21: A misplaced cluster of rocks and branches. One of the rocks was floating (Bug #30444).</li>
<li>03027F6D: A terminal linked backwards from a spotlight (0301EC6F) and a turret (03027F71) (Bug #30657).</li>
<li>Roadside Pines: A leveled raider in power armor (001CCBB8) was forced by EMSystemTurf to use a wall lean marker while he was not in combat. This also forced him to exit from his power armor which he was unable to re-enter later on and which was usually found abandoned at the place of that marker (Bug #24597).</li>
<li>Quincy Ruins: A leveled gunner boss in power armor (00225378) was forced by EMSystemTurf to use a terminal while he was not in combat. This also forced him to exit from his power armor which he was unable to re-enter later on and which was usually found abandoned and clipping into the table the terminal is sitting on (Bug #24597).</li>
<li>Suffolk County Charter School: A terminal (0019A804) with no use has been disabled. The game data suggest that it was supposed to display some specific text, but this was never added by the developers (Bug #27222).</li>
<li>0704B75A: A wall piece was added to hide a gap between the wall pieces 000E1C39 and 00057BB6 (Bug #29463).</li>
<li>03054107, 03054108, 03054109, 0305410A, 0305410B: All Islander's Almanacs were missing the DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad script (Bug #30538).</li>
<li>0021FD4B: An absolete trigger that was moved out of the way by the patch earlier had to have its LocRefType removed, in order to prevent it from eventually ending up in an alias on DN084 (Bug #26181).</li>
<li>001A861A: A trigger, scripted to enable a linked reference that doesn't exist. It has been moved out of the way (Bug #26283).</li>
<li>0009D29E: A terminal linked with a wrong keyword to a door (Bug #25728).</li>
<li>07040C29, 07040C2A: Room corner pieces added to hide a seethrough gap in a wall. (Bug #28542)</li>
<li>00120730, 00120733, 00120775, 00120780, 001E80B0, 001E80B1: Benches that are placed backwards. (Bug #29455)</li>
<li>000A0E14, 000A0E15: Misplaced consumables. (Bug #29578)</li>
<li>000E7B59: Misplaced bakery ticket. (Bug #29622)</li>
<li>001E45D9: Cotton yarn with an incorrect ownership setting. (Bug #29622)</li>
<li>000A2D11: Minuteman corpse placed slightly below the surface of the ground. (Bug #30294)</li>
<li>000A2D12, 000A2D13, 000A2D14: Fusion cells and a stimpack that shouldn't have been set to respawn. (Bug #30294)</li>
<li>000A4AB8: Dirty Tan Suit partially stuck in collision of a locker, possibly making it impossible to pick up. (Bug #30554)</li>
<li>00096A8F: Misplaced box. (Bug #30592)</li>
<li>00232591, 00232592, 00232593, 00232596, 002325A2, 002325A4, 002325A5, 002325A6, 002325A9: Misplaced junk items. (Bug #30592)</li>
<li>00232595: Misplaced seat. (Bug #30592)</li>
<li>0023E76B: Weapons workbench clipping with wall slightly. (Bug #30592)</li>
<li>00044257: Wrong base type used on an opened first aid box. (Bug #30617)</li>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Four of the shipment objects which can be purchased from vendors were not set to calculate their prices properly. (shipment_Screws_small, shipment_Fertilizer_small, DLC02shipment_Concrete_100, DLC02shipment_Concrete_200) (Bug #29114)</li>
<li>Combat knifes and switchblades could not be mounted on short weapon racks (DLC05WorkshopWeaponRackShort01). Their weapon type keywords did not allow for discerning them from larger weapons that would not fit on a small rack, the script on the rack was missing a set of properties for attaching knifes, and the rack mesh (Meshes\DLCß5\SetDressing\Workshop\WeaponRack\DLC05WorkshopWeaponRackShort01.nif) was missing a node that was suitable for placing a knife (Bug #28936).</li>
<li>DLC04_LL_Armor_DisciplesA, DLC04_LL_Armor_DisciplesB, DLC04_LL_Armor_DisciplesC, DLC04_LL_Armor_DisciplesD: These lists had to be modified because they could generate leg and underarmor items together with an armored skirt which occupies the leg armor and underarmor slots already. Depending on the order in which the game euqipped the items, this could result in the actors either wearing no underarmor or having an extra armored skirt in their inventory (Bug #28274).</li>
<li>Mod_Armor_Synth_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection: The muffled mod for synth armor pieces could not be attached to arm pieces at a workbench although epic armors created by the game at run time had it appear on both arm and leg armor pieces (Bug #29056).</li>
<li>Due to having a zero duration setting, Ware's Brew would fail to provide the proper amount of radiation removal in survival mode (Bug #29444).</li>
<li>ArmorPoweredFrameBOS: The BoS power armor frame was mistakenly using the armor addon for the raider power armor frame (Bug #29447).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Vault88: Six pre-placed dead molerats (05004766, 05004767, 05004768, 05004769, 0500476A, 0500476B) in a cavern in the northern sector were never cleaned up either. They will now get disabled when the vault unloads after the player has been in that area (Bug #26732).</li>
<li>Vault88: Two pre-placed dead raiders (05001BCD, 05001BBE) were never cleaned up. They will now disappear when the nearby objects are scrapped (Bug #28895).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_TorsoLegsUnderarmorSkirt: This armor was missing a world model and used the raider harness instead. A new mesh (Meshes\DLC04\Clothes\Operators\Operators_HeavyArmor_TorsoLegsSkirt_GO.nif) was created to fix this (Bug #28972).</li>
<li>Meshes\Architecture\Buildings\SmallTown\Bld03FreeSidingARes02.nif: To fix a gap in this mesh without touching the precombs, a small helper mesh was created (Meshes\Architecture\Buildings\SmallTown\Bld03FreeSidingARes02Cap.nif) and placed on all eight occurrences of the mesh in the game world (Bug #19582).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC04:DLC04SettlementDoctorScript: The HealRadiation function needs to calculate the value as a float instead of an integer or Dr. Mackenzie will not be able to fully heal radiation damage in all cases. (Bug #29319)</li>
<li>ChainedDoor: Fixed a faulty condition check that could result in this script running when it was not supposed to run (Bug #25659).</li>
<li>CompCurieAvoidDeathScript: Unbound script check added (Bug #28912).</li>
<li>DialogueCovenantScript: Locking and unlocking of the shop and office doors at Covenant is handled by an OnLocationChange() event that runs when the player arrives at Covenant. For all the time he subsequently stays at Covenant, the lock states set by that event remain unchanged. Thus, if the player arrives at night or early in the morning, the doors would remain closed, no matter how long he's waiting, and likewise, if he arrives during the day, they would always remain open. There is a timer event running to start shop and office closing scenes in the evening, but these scenes do not change the actual lock state of the doors. Unfortunately, the script cannot lock the doors, because it has no control on where the player is when it does, so there would be a risk of locking him in the shop or office for the night. Unlocking the doors however bears no risk, so the timer event has been altered to do this in the morning, in case they were still locked when he arrived. That's not a perfect solution, but the result is pretty much the same as what the vanilla scripts were doing anyway if the player arrived at day time (Bug #28475).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_GZVaultTecMisterScript: Fixed an animation graph error (Bug #27248).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_RobotLiftLightScript: Fixed animation graph errors (Bug #27291).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04MQ01GauntletQuestScript: Fixed an issue where trying to equip an item failed with an error (Bug #25633).</li>
<li>DLC05:WeaponRackScript: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #28284).</li>
<li>DN084_OverridesQuestScript: The timers started by this script confused the timer IDs with the timer delays. As a result, AI overrides that should have been applied to the player followers during  the Mass Fusion quest only temporarily were never properly removed, and companions could eventually stop following. Also added sanity checks for empty follower aliases (Bug #25852).</li>
<li>FollowersScript: Added a missing sanity check (Bug #28259).</li>
<li>MQ106InvestgationDummySCRIPT: For no obvious reason, this script did not start any scenes that did not involve interactions with Dogmeat. As a result, the activate prompts on most clues at the investigation sites remained unresponsive and numerous player voice lines that were supposed to be played when activating those clues were never heard in the game (Bug #19578).</li>
<li>PAFramePurchaseScript: Fixed an issue with an operator, added a missing sanity check and removed a Delete() call that never worked (Bug #22210).</li>
<li>MirelurkAmbushArtScript: Fixed an issue related to animation event registrations (Bug #29374).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Fixed an issue that could result in workshop actors being counted twice for total population (Bug #29148). Also on this script, the AssignActorToObject() function was slightly modified to make sure that supply lines get properly deleted if a provisioner is assigned to a different work object (Bug #27671).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>At the end of Here There Be Monsters (MS02), if you help Zao repair the submarine he tells you he's going to leave for China. The game never actually disables his sub in the bay or any of the associated objects around it. (Bug #29042)</li>
<li>During startup initialization it was possible for quest DN019 (the control quest for Emogene at the amphitheater) to finish its setup before The Secret of Cabot House (MS09) had completed its own setup. If this happens, the alias in DN019 will not be filled and the failure will also block the Emogene alias in MS09 from filling. This then causes her to not be present during the stages where you rescue her from the amphitheater. (Bug #25262) [NR]</li>
<li>Marty Bullfinch's body can be too easily culled from the game when the player passes close to Faneuil Hall. This can result in Nick Valentine commenting on his corpse long after it's gone. The corpse should now remain in the game until you actually pass by it on the related quest. (Bug #28951) [NR]</li>
<li>Inst306 (End of the Line): Completing this quest did not fail other Railroad quests because it never started the Railroad kickout handler (RRKickout) as it should have (Bug #28960).</li>
<li>MinRadiantOwned06ChangeLocOnly, MinRadiantOwned07ChangeLocOnly, MinRadiantOwned10ChangeLocOnly: These quests did repeatedly shut down and fail all objectives if the player left the workshop location while they were still running, because a script variable had a wrong start value specified (Bug #29134).</li>
<li>CustomItemQuest, DLC01MasterQuest, DLC03_CustomItemQuest, DLC04_CustomItemQuest: Because of a design error in the quests that handle the creation of unique armor and weapon items at run time, external scripts that called these quests for creating items had no control on whether these items were actually existing already when they ran subsequent operations on them. This usually resulted in glitches such as the items not being equipped by their actors and ending up in their inventories instead, but on rare occasions, the items could also go missing entirely or were never created. This fix includes modifications to CustomItemQuestScript (Bug #28982) [NR].</li>
<li>DLC04RaiderKickOut (Open Season): The script on this quest (DLC04:DLC04KOQuestScript) failed to make Fritsch hostile when the player was kicked out of the raider factions, presumably because he's not in any of the raider factions that were already taken care of by this script (Bug #21317).</li>
<li>DLC04SettlementFF01 (Amoral Combat): This quest did not fail as it should have when the player was kicked out of the raider factions, because it was missing a DLC04KickOutHandlerScript and thus did not react to the kick-out event sent by DLC04RaiderKickOut (Open Season). Its shutdown is now handled by DLC04:DLC04KOQuestScript (Bug #21317).</li>
<li>MinVsInst ("Pinned"): Fixed an issue where disabling an actor failed due to a conflict with enable parents (Bug #25855) [NR].</li>
<li>MS07b (The Gilded Grasshopper): Removed a line from the stage 20 fragment that always failed with an error but was not needed anyway (Bug #29372).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Scribe Haylen's terminal in the Cambridge Police Station [BoS_DN130_HaylenTerminalSub02] is supposed to have an entry displayed about the player after first joining the Brotherhood of Steel but this entry is set to check for a non-existant quest stage.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0003B2D8: A trigger in Fraternal Post that had wrong property values specified on its DefaultRefOnTriggerEnter script, so it could be triggered by the player although this was not intended according to a note on quest DN048 (Bug #29362).</li>
<li>00137C61: A trap that was missing an "initially disabled" flag (Bug #28573).</li>
<li>0015D381: Superfluous trigger disabled and moved out of the way (Bug #25849).</li>
<li>001BAA97: Unlinked this trigger from its enable parent to resolve conflicts with the script running on it and modified the BoSEnable quest to handle it separately (Bug #25849).</li>
<li>00107157: A door on College Square with a script that tried to set a stage on DN049 (General Atomics Galleria quest) when it was opened. Since the door is entirely unrelated to DN049, this script had to be removed (Bug #28312) [NR].</li>
<li>00183C94: Faulty script properties corrected on AttractionObjectScript running on this reference (Bug #28504).</li>
<li>001342E2: A dead raider with faulty script properties that led the scrpt running on him to mistake him for bloody rags (Bug #28574).</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li><s>Nukalurk Eggs (DLC04_NukalurkEgg_Harvestable) were not generating the correct type of ingestible egg because no such object had been created. They were instead substituting Mirelurk Eggs. (Bug #27393)</s> [UFO4P 2.1.6]</li>
<li>The Hooded Clean Room Suit (AAClothesInstituteWorkerHat) uses an incorrect model for the female version. (Bug #27175)</li>
<li>Firebelly uses an incorrect Stimpak mesh when it should be represented by the vodka bottle instead. (Bug #26457)</li>
<li>It was not possible to mount the Cryolater on one of the Contraptions weapon racks. (Bug #21340)</li>
<li>10mm Large Magazine loose mods should now be attachable to 10mm pistols. (Bug #21188)</li>
<li>The Hardened Receiver for combat rifles (mod_CombatRifle_Receiver_MoreDamage1) had corrupted text in its object filter window. (Bug #25421)</li>
<li>The Standard Magazine for combat rifles (mod_CombatRifle_Mag_Small) had an incorrect reload speed modifier set on it. (Bug #25421)</li>
<li>The Hardened Automatic Receiver for the Handmade Rifle does not reduce damage as the description calls for. (Bug #25413)</li>
<li>Swan Boat Fragments do not have any carry weight. (Bug #28553)</li>
<li>The mini-nuke parts in Gorksi Cabin had no weight or value. Since there are 4 parts, the sensible solution is to divide the weight and value evenly based on a fully assembled mini-nuke. (Bug #28276)</li>
<li>Melee saw blade weapons added by Automatron all say they add bleeding damage but it was never added to the OMODs. [DLC01Bot_Hand_Melee_HammerSaw_Left, DLC01Bot_Hand_MrHandy_Melee_Saw_Left, DLC01Bot_Hand_Melee_Saw_Left, DLC01Bot_Hand_MrHandy_Melee_Saw_Middle, DLC01Bot_Hand_Melee_HammerSaw_Right, DLC01Bot_Hand_MrHandy_Melee_Saw_Right, DLC01Bot_Hand_Melee_Saw_Right] (Bug #25383)</li>
<li>The throwable caltrop item [DLC03_ThrowingCaltropWeapon] should not explode when shot at because it's not an explosive device.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>No LOD was ever generated for the Nuka-World transit station in the western part of the Commonwealth. This has now been corrected. (meshes\terrain\Commonwealth\Objects\Commonwealth.4.-28.4.bto, meshes\terrain\Commonwealth\Objects\Commonwealth.8.-32.0.bto) (Bug #24429)</li>
<li>The Kiddie Kingdom Employee Tunnels (DLC04KiddieKingdomTunnels01) and the Secure Beverageer Lab (DLC04BottlingPlant02) both have water planes in them that don't function correctly because the cells lacked the "Has Water" flag. (Bug #27511)</li>
<li>A corrupted navmesh in Far Harbor at cell -5, 10 caused edge links to neighboring cells to be broken due to an unresolved form ID. (Bug #27591)</li>
<li>MassGravelAndSandExt: Mass Gravel & Sand and Mass Fusion Disposal Site were mistakenly merged together as one location (MassFusionCoolantDisposalLocation). The map marker at Mass Gravel & Sand (MassGravelAndSandLocation) was also incorrectly set to use the one at the Mass Fusion building. (Bug #28210)</li>
<li>POIJoel06: The exterior cell at Electronic Hobbyist's Club (POIJoel06Location) wasn't properly set as part of the location. This resulted in the exterior area resetting despite never being intended to do so. (Bug #28217)</li>
<li>0000DF63: A wilderness cell was mistakenly included as part of CambridgePDLocation. It is located a significant distance away from the police station. (Bug #28840)</li>
<li>Nahant PD: Fixed several bad navmesh sections on the ground floor of Nahant PD that caused NPCs spawned there by a random encounter trigger to get stuck. To improve access to a doorway, the chair 001CAA10 was slightly moved (Bug #28079).</li>
<li>Shamrock Taphouse Exterior: A small platform with a patrol idle marker in front of Shamrock Taphouse was missing a navmesh (Bug #28477).</li>
<li>The MS Azalea area was mistakenly left set up as a workshop zone. Indications are this was once intended to be another settlement in Far Harbor but the work was never completed and left the entire zone in an inconsistent state.</li>
<li>3 cells on the east side of Barney's Bunker were not added to the location despite having objects and actors in them that are directly associated with the site.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Protectron Medics use the wrong material setting for their legs, resulting in them having green hips when they should be white like the rest of the body. (Materials\Actors\CreateABot\ProtectronLegsMEDIC.BGSM) (Bug #28471)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Food buffs become permanently stuck on the player in survival mode due to incorrectly using a perk to hard set the effect values to 0 each time something is eaten instead of using a multiplier to correct it. (Bug #27210) [NR]</li>
<li>The Nuclear Physicist perk ranks were not correctly calculating their bonuses for Fusion Cores or the Gatling Laser and had some other oddities which causes them to interact badly with other related perks. (Bug #23503, Bug #22528, Bug #23439)</li>
<li>CarlaMarkdownPerk: Due to a missing actor check, Carla's discount perk mistakenly applied to all vendors (Bug #28351).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DN092_IntercomTrig_Script: Modified this script to disable the triggers it's running on once DN092 has shut down. At this point, the scenes supposed to get started by the triggers are no longer available and all subsequent operations of this script would fail with errors (Bug #28243).</li>
<li>CircuitBreakerMasterScript: Added missing 3D checks (Bug #26372).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_AddFormsEffectScript: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #28385).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03CoA_FFNucleus03DeconButtonScript: Added sanity checks (Bug #26421).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03POI04DummyNoteScript: Removed an invalid event registration and added a missing sanity check (Bug #26393).</li>
<li>DN143RemoveFromCaptiveFaction: Modified this script to stop it from trying to manipulate dead actors (Bug #26285).</li>
<li>DoorChain: Missing sanity checks added (Bug #27368).</li>
<li>ElevatorMasterScript: Added two missing sanity checks (Bug #26286).</li>
<li>RESceneRJ02_NoteScript: Modified a condition check to avoid errors when a note changes containers after RESceneRJ02 has stopped running (Bug #28107).</li>
<li>VertibirdMobilityScript: Added an AI check to avoid errors when trying to play an idle (Bug #26244).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_TrackSystemTrack: A while loop could become hopelessly stuck in an endless loop, becoming an unbound object, when the player leaves the Mechanist's Lair. This would then result in serious script lag, and if the Papyrus logs are on, multiple gigs worth of data after a long session. (Bug #28753) [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Raider combat idles were not restricted to members of RaiderFaction and could incorrectly get used by other types of NPCs who are not meant to be raiders. (Bug #28474)</li>
<li>Maisie (the cat at Abernathy Farm) should now properly be culled upon being killed. The alias on DialogueAbernathyFarm has been marked optional and given the UFO4P script to clear an alias when dead. (Bug #25943) [NR]</li>
<li>When talking to Blake Abernathy initially, the player can ask if Blake means "Preston's Crew". The player says the line over the top of Blake's response to it due to a missing scene flag. (Bug #20254)</li>
<li>A dead scavenger near Hubris Comics that carries a hint note could be culled from the game before being discovered. An alias for this scavenger has been added to The Silver Shroud (MS04) to preserve him until the quest is completed. (Bug #26394) [NR]</li>
<li>When returning to Ada in A New Threat (DLC01MQ02) it is possible to get stuck in the dialogue chain because one of her responses did not have the proper scene selected to start after she greets you. (Bug #27603)</li>
<li>Desdemona should not be mentioning Coursers in conjunction with the player infiltrating the Institute if the Institute is destroyed already, or the player has been permanently kicked out. (Bug #27237)</li>
<li>In quests InstM01Post and DialogueWarwickHomestead the alias for Cedric Hopton prevents his corpse from being removed from the game if he's killed. (Bug #26804) [NR]</li>
<li>The bodies of Theo Collins, his robots, and his turrets are never cleared if you kill them during Mystery Meat (DN079). (Bug #26795) [NR]</li>
<li>Also with DN079, if you exit the building to talk to Rylee before first speaking with Theo, the quest would get stuck and be unable to advance if you asked her about people getting sick. Her response was unnecessarily setting a quest stage that was never used for anything. (Bug #26478)</li>
<li>Speaking to Danny Sullivan more than once after arriving at Diamond City could result in him repeating his greeting and thus offering you access to the second speech option you're not supposed to get if you used the other one. It's not clear entirely where this was tripping up, but setting the scene to move to stage 10 upon closing out has resolved the problem. (Bug #28441)</lI>
<li>During Safari Adventure (DLC04SafariAdventureQuest) Cito would comment on never having "been here" even if he had been convinced to stay behind to defend his family. The scene should only run if he follows you into the cloning facility. (Bug #26341)</li>
<li>Diamond City security guards would erroneously make comments about the player having a robot companion if Curie had already become a synth, due to the dialogue not checking her race first. (Bug #23838)</li>
<li>At the end of Cappy in a Haystack (DLC04MS01) the quest journal will indicate that you kept Bradberton alive even if you agreed to shut off the power to his life support. A condition on the journal was missing which caused the game to always display the alternative entry. (Bug #23880) [NR]</li>
<li>Gunners aliases in REAssaultSC18_FactionMMvsGunners were mistakenly being forced to use synth voices, which was causing them to talk like synths. They should have been set to revert to the voice type of the NPC instead. (Bug #23885)</li>
<li>DialogueVault81Guards [001A0AE0]: A hello topic intended to only play if the player character is female was erroneously checking to see if the player is male. As a result, Vault 81 guards would sometimes comment on how the player is a "brave woman" even if they are male. (Bug #28309)</li>
<li>REChokepointRJ01 [001AC234, 001AC241]: Two Gunner responses are using condition checks that incorrectly perform a gender check on subject, instead of on player. This could result in the Gunner addressing the player character as "sir" if they are female. (Bug #28397)</li>
<li>RESceneJSDN062 (Dead raiders with food paste and intervention note): This encounter could repeat infinitely although the scene is unique and the note addresses one of the raiders with a unique name. It will now stop reoccurring once the player has taken the note from the raider's body (Bug #28305).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0004541A: Floating X-Marker Heading (Bug #28477).</li>
<li>001ACBF4: Spotlight trigger that wasn't linked to the same enable marker as its spotlight (Bug #26324).</li>
<li>Wandering turrets: The turrets 00075983, 00183442, 00183443, 001ADDE5, 001E2E95, 001EC5AD were placed on areas with no navmesh, causing them to wander off after a cell reset because the engine moves all actors spawned at run time onto a working navmesh. To fix this, small navmesh islands were created and shoved underneath them. Another two turrets, 0009398F and 0017FD4B were wandering off because the navmesh they were sitting on was buried below the supports on which they were placed. This has been fixed by edits to the existing navmeshes. Finally, the turret 00077C72 could wander off due to NPC interference (upon cell reset, an NPC placed close nearby may spawn before the turret does, and if he starts moving only a little, he may be standing in the spot of the turret when the game tries to place the turret). This was fixed by moving the NPC 0007432F some distance away from the turret (Bug #28098).</li>
<li>071F9BDE: Missing ceiling panel has been placed at Slocum's Joe HQ. (Bug #28515)</li>
<li>00072C1B, 000B1303: Set LOD flag on these objects so that they can be properly seen from a distance. (Bug #28512)</li>
<li>001F7AC5: Fusion generator that erroneously had a door set as its linked light to flash when the core is taken. This generator has no lights near it so the property just needs to be cleared or the door it was linked to will be permanently screwed up. (Bug #28232) [NR]</li>
<li>0018E835: Set to non-respawning to prevent the door into Big John's Salvage from resetting spontaneously. (Bug #25317)</li>
<li>001A7940: Linked object chain missing its LinkCustom01 keyword property. (Bug #26680)</li>
<li>06021257, 060224A5, 06028E8C, 06023DDF, 03046639, 03027569, 030500AD, 0304A60C, 0304A5E6, 03022688: Vault-Tech Lunchboxes placed using the wrong activation object. (Bug #27199)</li>
<li>001A8E64, 001A8E67, 001A8E66: Security bar and linked components that should not be resetting at Kingsport Lighthouse. (Bug #26796)</li>
<li>001E81D0: Water plane which was not matched to the height of the cell next to it, causing a minor gap. (Bug #26731)</li>
<li>03056C00: Terminal that is not linked properly to its associated spotlights. (Bug #26597)</li>
<li>001BE099: Floating tricycle. (Bug #28110)</li>
<li>0013039C: Changed the HavokOnHit property on an oxygen tank from true to false. Defaultdisablehavokonload would throw an error on rare occasions when the reference loses 3D during a hit event.</li>
<li>00215293: Misplaced jukebox. (Bug #28326)</li>
<li>07026ED9, 0703D469, 0703D46A, 0703D46D: Grass mounds placed to cover exposed gaps in the terrain. (Bug #28369, Bug #28275, Bug #28117)</li>
<li>002278E0: Misplaced weapon mod. (Bug #28386)</li>
<li>001390D8, 00139125: Misplaced radios. (Bug #28393, Bug #28292)</li>
<li>00139124: Misplaced bell. (Bug #28393)</li>
<li>0006AE02, 00094A26, 00094A27, 00094A36, 00094A5E, 00094A5F, 00094A68, 00094A69, 00094AAB, 0009608E, 0009609D, 000960E6, 0009610F, 0009612B, 0009612C, 0009612D, 0009612E, 0009612F, 00096130, 00096142, 00096143, 00096147, 00096148, 00096149, 00117D53, 00117D54, 00117D56, 001AB84F: Some movable references that are initially located underneath the water before the quarry at Thicket Excavations is drained are missing their proper enable parent settings. (Bug #28437)
<li>000AEAB3, 000AEAB4: Sleeping bags that are using the wrong base types. (Bug #28452)</li>

<li>07015DC8: Beach dune placed to cover an exposed gap in the terrain. (Bug #28539)</li>
<li>000D182E, 000D182F: The map markers for Mass Pike Tunnel West and Mass Pike Tunnel East were mistakenly set as a settlement. They were intended to be set as a Sewer/Utility Tunnel instead. (Bug #28540)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The outfits Wastelander01, Wastelander02 and Wastelander02WithHood returned two full body outfits instead of one. The superfluous entries have been removed (Bug #27802).</li>
<li>Outfit_CaravanGuard contained two leg armor pieces that cannot be equipped at the same time as the underarmor. This could (but not always did!) result in the actors ending up naked. To fix this, the superfluous leg armor pieces have been removed from the outfit. A retro script will update the caravan guards at run time. For all other actors using this outfit, the fix is not retroactive though (Bug #27378).</li>
<li>The disciples, operators and pack armor items and a few miscellaneous Nuka-World clothing items not yet addressed in UFO4P 2.0.9 could not be scrapped. Scrap recipes have been set up as follows: DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_LegLeft, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_LegRight and DLC04_Armor_Pack_UltraLight_Torso_MasonsNecklace will return one piece of bone. DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_Helmet_01/02, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_TorsoLegsUnderarmor_Skirt, DLC04_Armor_NukaGirlOutfit, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_Hat_01, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Mason, DLC04_Armor_Pack_UltraLight_Torso_02/03, DLC04_Armor_Western_01/02/03/05, DLC04_MS01_ClothesNukaWorldJumpsuit, DLC04_Unique_Eyepatch_Gage and DLC04_Unique_Clothes_WildmanOutfit will return one piece of cloth. DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_Helmet_Glasses, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_Helmet_Goggles and DLC04_MS01Glasses will return one piece of glass. DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_ArmLeft_01, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_ArmRight_01, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_LegLeft_01, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_LegRight_01, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_Torso, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_ArmLeft, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_ArmRight, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_ArmLeft, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_ArmRight, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_Hat_02, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_MaskAndHat_05, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_LegLeft, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_LegRight and DLC04_Armor_Western_04 will return one piece of leather. DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_Mask_02, DLC04_Armor_Pack_UltraLight_Torso_01, DLC04_Armor_SpaceSuit and DLC04_Armor_SpaceSuit_Helmet will return one piece of plastic. DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_ArmLeft_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_ArmRight_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_Helmet, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_LegLeft_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_LegRight_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Heavy_Torso, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Helmet_Dixie, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Helmet_Male, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Helmet_Nisha, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_ArmLeft_02, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_ArmRight_02, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_LegLeft_02, DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Light_LegRight_02, DLC04_Armor_Gage, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_ArmLeft_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_ArmRight_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_LegLeft_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_LegRight_A/B, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_Torso, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Heavy_TorsoLegsUnderarmorSkirt, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_ArmLeft_01/02, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_ArmRight_01/02, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_LegLeft, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_LegRight, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_Torso_01/02, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Light_TorsoLegsUnderarmorSkirt, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_Helmet, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_Helmet_Animal_01/02/03 and DLC04_Armor_Pack_Heavy_Torso will return one piece of steel. DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_Mask_03, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Helmet_MaskAndHat_01/04 and DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_Torso will return one pieve of wood (Bug #27456).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>MS19MiscVault81 could complete its objective to visit vault 81 when the player approached Big John's salvage because wilderness cell 2,-13 (just outside of Big John's salvage) was erroneously flagged as belonging to vault 81 location (Bug #27875).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh, Material, and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Vault 75 has a number of holes in various meshes that needed to be corrected with custom fit pieces. [Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResCorIn01MetalPlateConcrete.nif, Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResCorInHalf03FloorMetalPlateConcrete.nif, Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResWall01MetalPlateConcrete.nif, Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResWallHalf01MetalPlateConcrete.nif, Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResWallInsetHalf01Ceiling.nif, Meshes\UFO4P\Interiors\Vault\HallRes\VltHallResWallWreck01Concrete.nif] (Bug #23813, Bug #23649, Bug #27846)</li>
<li>Razorgrain and corn (Meshes\Landscape\Plants\CornStalk01.nif, CornStalk01Empty.nif, CornStalk01Hulk.nif, CornStalk01HulkDebris.nif, CornStalk02.nif, CornStalk02Empty.nif, CornStalk02Hulk.nif, CornStalk02HulkDebris.nif, RazorgrainPlant01.nif, RazorgrainPlant01Empty.nif, RazorgrainPlant01Hulk.nif, RazorgrainPlant02.nif, RazorgrainPlant02Empty.nif, RazorgrainPlant02Hulk.nif) will no longer float when placed on even landscapes (Bug #20487).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>MQ03CodsworthHolotapeScript: Enabling the holotape by this script never worked because the holotape is enable-parented. To fix this, the enable marker had to be added as a new script property to the holotape alias of quest MQ102 (Bug #27645).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03MQ06_NukeHandlingScript: Added a missing sanity check (Bug #27847).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04ArcadeController: Removed the call of a cleanup function from the OnReset() event that was supposed to clear a number of arrays that don't exist after a reset. This could result in massive log spam because this script is extended by more than a dozen of other scripts that run on a myriad of Nuka World references (Bug #27668).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_GZNukaGalaxyLightMarkerScript: Added a missing sanity check (Bug #27296) and improved a trigger event that ran more often than required, resulting in much unnecessary script activity and a wall of animation graph errors on the papyrus log (Bug #27297).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_GZNukaGalaxySignScript: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #27462).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_KK_SceneStarter: Added checks to prevent this script from trying to start or stop scenes on a quest that is not running (Bug #27422).</li>
<li>DLC04_NUK001_CrowdManagerQuestScript: Fixed an issue where this script started to spill out of range errors because an external script removed references from a collection alias while this script was looping through it (Bug #25644).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_RQ_QuestScript: Added a missing sanity check (Bug #27440).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04KickOutHandlerScript: Added checks to skip unnecessary event handling once the quest this script is running on has entered its shutdown stage (Bug #27423).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04MQ05WeatherOverrideScript: Added missing sanity checks (Bug #27457).</li>
<li>DLC05:DLC05InitScript: Added a missing sanity check (Bug #27662).</li>
<li>DN136_AttackKlaxonDestScript: Fixed animation graph errors, 3D issues and a potential infinite loop issue (Bug #26177).</li>
<li>FollowersScript: Actors without a TeleportActorScript attached (e.g. Dogmeat) were never properly teleported because the TeleportActor() function on this script called MoveTo() on the wrong actor instance (Bug #26179).</li>
<li>SecurityBarScript: Added missing checks for invalid sound instances (Bug #27646).</li>
<li>SuperMutantSuiciderScript: Added an unbound script check (Bug #25871).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>RETreasureHuntSC01, RETreasureHuntSC02, RETreasureHuntSC03, RETreasureHuntSC04, RETreasureHuntSC05, RETreasureHuntSC06_DN070: Bodies placed by instances of these quests that did shut down prematurely (this always happens if the player does not take the note before the area unloads) were never cleaned up, and the player could loot truncated notes from them a long time after the quest instances that created them had stopped running. Since it turned out that the cleanup was blocked by the quest items left on the bodies, all quest scripts were modified to remove them before shutting down (Bug #24639).</li>
<li>MinRadiantOwned03ChangeLocOnly (Kidnapped Trader) could not be started because the settlement spokesman's dialogue depended on a faulty quest stage check that never returned true (Bug #25210).</li>
<li>A script was added to the Far Harbor NPC collection aliases on DLC03DialogueFarHarbor and DLC03MQ06_WindfarmHandling to remove any actors if they die, so their corpses can be cleaned up by the game eventually and will not stay in the game world forever (Bug #26814) [NR].</li>
<li>DLC04Grandchester: Fixed two null-pointer properties (Bug #27458).</li>
<li>MinRadiantOwned10ChangeLocOnly: Removed several lines from the stage 100 and 400 fragments that referenced non-existing quest obectives (Bug #27439).</li>
<li>DLC04MS01Post, DLC04MS01BradbertonDies, DLC04MS01SierraAttacks: Fixed scene properties that were mistakenly pointing to a wooden crate (Bug #27556).</li>
<li>DLC03MQ06_NukeHandling: Added sanity checks for empty follower aliases to the stage 150 fragment (Bug #26513).</li>
<li>DLC06E01: Missing sanity check added to the stage 9000 fragment (Bug #26021).</li>
<li>DN028: Removed two lines from the stage 10 and stage 500 fragments that tried to enable/disable the dungeon boss. This does not work (and never did) because this actor is controlled by an enable parent (Bug #26485).</li>
<li>DN092: Checks added to the stage 76 fragment to prevent the quest from trying to initiate combat with dead actors (Bug #27661).</li>
<li>FFDiamondCity12: Added a check to the stage 35 fragment to prevent the quest from trying to initiate combat with dead actors (Bug #27904).</li>
<li>MS11MiscCharleston could complete its objective to check out the USS Constitution when the player approached Faneuil Hall and had not been anywhere near the ship yet. This happened because USSConstitutionLocation consists of two detached cell clusters (one around the pre-quest ship in Charlestown and another around the post-quest ship near Faneuil Hall) and the quest was relying on a default script that only checked whether the player got into the right location but not whether he also was in the right cell cluster. To fix this, a tailored script has been added that performs an appropriate distance check in addition to the location check (Bug #27257) [NR].</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlements & Workshops</u></b>
<ul>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: The happiness malus applied to settlements as a penalty for the player killing a protected settler did also apply to synth infiltrators killed during a synth attack although they had their protected flags removed by the synth attack quest scripts (Bug #27621).</li>
<li>After workshop attacks, settlers will no longer remain stuck infinitely in a "thank you" dialogue loop. DLC01WorkshopBotRaiderAttack01, DLC01WorkshopBotRaiderAttack02, DLC01WorkshopRobotAttack01, DLC01WorkshopRobotAttack02, WorkshopDeathclawAttack01, WorkshopDeathclawAttack02, WorkshopMirelurkAttack_SI, WorkshopRadScorpionAttack01, WorkshopSupermutantAttack02 and WorkshopYaoGuaiAttack01 were not properly configured to use the shared dialogue topics supposed to set the stage that removes the settlers from the attack specific dialogue faction after having spoken to the player (Bug #20304).</li>
<li>The recruitement radio beacon at the Nuka World workshop never played a radio scene because the WorkshopScript running on DLC04RedRocketWorkshopREF had an invalid radio transmitter property specified which was interpreted by WorkshopParentScript as an override transmitter and made it look for an override radio scene that does not exist. To fix this, the offending property on DLC04RedRocketWorkshopREF was cleared and WorkshopParentScript modified to fall back to the generic radio scene in such cases (Bug #27562).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: The workshop scripts never intended to create more than one free brahmin for workshops that didn't have one, but used a workshop resource rating value for tracking this. Though, workshop resource rating values don't get updated while a workshop is not loaded, so if the first brahmin was created while it was not loaded, the scripts did continue to create brahmins until the player visited this workshop for the next time. To fix this, WorkshopParentScript does now update the brahmin resource rating value "manually" when a brahmin is created (Bug #27622).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC04GZNukaGalaxy_TerminalLighting: Invalid properties removed (Bug #27295).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>07010F99: Concrete wall placed to hide a seam between the adjacent walls. (Bug #27853)</li>
<li>07010F9A: Ceiling panel added to hide a gap in the precombs for Vault 81. (Bug #27851)</li>
<li>00193DC9, 000F976C: Beds separated from the one between them due to being inaccessible to NPCs. Navmesh in the same cell has been adjusted to match. (Bug #27813)</li>
<li>0602FA24: Missing properties added on DefaultMusicActivateScript (Bug #27461).</li>
<li>060423F3: Fixed an actor property on a script attached to this trigger that was mistakenly pointing to the parent actor base (Bug #27459).</li>
<li>00182E1A, 00183273, 00183C78, 0018F006, 0002B910, 0304A666, 0304A667, 0304A669, 0304A669: Follower comment objects with inappropriate script property values (Bugs #25520, #26289, #26299, #26391, #27616).</li>
<li>0602ED2F, 0604864B: Chained doors with missing script properties (Bug #27332).</li>
<li>0018591E: A navcut box that was missing the "initially disabled" flag and therefore blocked the passage of a bridge for NPCs during the entire game (Bug #27567).</li>
<li>Added a tree log to cover a landscape gap in cell GeneralAtomicsGalleriaExt05 (Bug #27849).</li>
<li>03049448: A hot plate missing a link to the pan 0304944C placed on its top, so the pan did not start havok settling when the hot plate was grabbed (Bug #23892).</li>
<li>06056D67: Fireworks effect missing an "initially disabled" flag (Bug #26254).</li>
<li>000919ED: Removed an obsolete script from this reference that was supposed to enable a linked reference that does not exist (Bug #23617).</li>
<li>001E2E6A: In a scene where a raider is burying another raider, the dead raider would not respawn after the first encounter. This has been fixed by creating a new actor base (UFO4P_POIJSCorpseRaiderFemale01_R) and adding the respawn flag. (Bug #26481)</li>
<li>001D6E7A: Car debris that would fall from the sky on cell reload because they were placed below the ground surface. (Bug #27560)</li>
<li>001817C7: Floating tripwire. (Bug #27569)</li>
<li>001D95FE: Misplaced assaultron torso. (Bug #27569)</li>
<li>0701C5E0, 0701C5E1: Grass mounds added to cover up gaps between railroad track pieces. (Bug #27569)</li>

<li>07030805: Debris pile added to cover up a gap underneath another debris pile. (Bug #27718)</li>
<li>000AE0F0, 000AE0F7: A lamp would remain floating in the air when a drawer it sits on is scrapped with the workbench. This was caused by missing linked reference settings. (Bug #27657)</li>
<li>0021B6FA: Misplaced Stealth Boy. (Bug #27829)</li>
<li>00085725, 00085726: Two feeding troughs outside of Diamond City were the wrong base type, which prevented Cricket’s brahmin from using them like was intended. (Bug #27951)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>ClothesMilitaryFatigues was missing instance naming rules (Bug #26816).</li>
<li>LLI_Armor_Raider_Boss_Outfit was using the wrong epic chance global (LL_EpicChance_Boss instead of LL_EpicChance_Armor_Boss). The leveled list added by UFO4P 2.0.6 to fix bug #25154 (UFO4P_LLI_Armor_Raider_Boss_Outfit _NoHelmet) has been updated to reflect this change as well (Bug #27363).</li>
<li>Rum bottles (BottleEmptyRum01) were missing a put down sound (Bug #27558).</li>
<li>Mod_armor_Combat_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, mod_armor_Leather_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection, mod_armor_Metal_Lining_Limb_ReducedDetection: these mods were using the ma_armor_<material>_Lining_LimbLeg keywords, but were in the mod collections for both arm and leg armor pieces. Thus, the game could create epic arm and leg armor pieces with muffled mods at run time but the player was not allowed to add these mods to anything else than leg armor pieces at the workbench, making muffled arm mods for no obvious reason the only non-unique/non-legendary mods in the game that could not be recreated by the player. Since the naming conventions ("Limb" instead of "LimbArm"/"LimbLeg" in the root names of all related object mods and misc mods) also suggest that these mods were actually intended to be applied to both arm and leg armor pieces, their mod association keywords have been changed to ma_armor_<material>_Lining_Limb to accomplish this (Bug #26715).</li>
<li>DLC04_Armor_Disciples_Underarmor_01/02/03/04, DLC04_Armor_Operators_Underarmor_01/02/03/04, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Light_LegsUnderarmor, DLC04_Armor_Pack_Underarmor_01/01a/ 01b/01c/01d/01e/01f/01g/02/03/04/05, DLC04_Armor_Western_Hat_01/01a/02/02a, DLC04_Clothing_HubologistRobes, DLC04_Logo_JacketAndPants_Underarmor_01/02/03/04/05 and DLC04_Logo_ShirtAndPants_Underarmor_01/02/03/04/05 were missing scrap recipes. They should return one piece of cloth when scrapped (Bug #27559).</li>
<li>Maxson's Battlecoat (ClothesMaxsonCoat) wasn't returning one piece of leather when scrapped like was intended. (Bug #27258)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Aliases for "The Cleansed" and Dara could not be cleared when needed due to not being marked as optional. [DLC04DialogueSettlement] (Bug #27293)</li>
<li>Missing perk property has been filled for Trip to the Stars (DLC04MS02). (Bug #27292)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid properties from DLC04RECampCT05. (Bug #27247)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid properties from DLC04REObjectCT04. (Bug #27229)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid properties from DLC04_KiddieKingdomMain. (Bug #27315)</li>
<li>REObjectJS01: This encounter places a note that is supposed to add a map marker when read by the player, but the quest could shut down before the player had read the note and no map marker was added at all (Bug #26736).</li>
<li>GhoulishPerkManager: Fixed an issue where two scripts running on the same alias that react to different events and are both configured to set a stage to stop the quest could cause a situation where one script stopped the quest and the other inadvertently tried to restart it if they did both start running around the same time (Bug #25530).</li>
<li>DLC04GZBattlezone: Flagged several aliases as optional to match requirements of the quest script (Bug #27308).</li>
<li>DLC04SafariAdventureQuest: Removed a line from the stage 10 fragment that tried to enable a reference which is controlled by an enable parent (Bug #27359) and another line from the stage 60 fragment that tried to enable a reference in a container (Bug #27360).</li>
<li>DLC06DialogueVault88: Fixed an issue in the stage 9000 fragment where the script failed to enable items after adding them to a container, instead of doing it the other way around (Bug #26022).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC04:Fragments:Quests:QF_DLC04GZBattlezone_010295C8: Stage 50 fragment had no sanity check for an empty companion alias. (Bug #27290)</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_RQ_QuestScript: No verification if the alias to check is filled before it tries to get the reference in it. (Bug #27249)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_BoSM01_000B1D79: Stage 91 fragment was attempting to set an incorrect objective. Instead of 25, it should be setting 65. (Bug #27240)</li>
<li>A sanity check had to be added to the damage helper validation procedure added to WorkshopObjectScript by UFO4P 1.0.5 to skip the operations if an object has no damage helper specified, because there are flora objects that are deliberately missing this property such as the vault 88 pipboy crate (Bug #26016).</li>
<li>Reincluded the modified version of DLC04:SetStageOnGainLOS (from UFO4P 2.0.0, Bug #21573) since it went missing from the archive somehow (Bug #27317).</li>
<li>ArtilleryReferenceScript: Removed a line that always failed with an error because it tried to play a sound from an unloaded object (Bug #26243).</li>
<li>BHExtBOSEnable: Added a missing sanity check and removed a disable call that never worked because all BHExtBOSEnable triggers are parented to an enable marker that is controlled by the quests Inst302 and Inst302Combat (Bug #25831).</li>
<li>CIS_ManagerScript: Added sanity checks to avoid log spam caused by the interaction scene handling for Curie and Deacon (Bug #25150).</li>
<li>Default2StateActivator: Added code to the SetOpen() function to further improve the handling of animation calls on unloaded references (Bug #25838).</li>
<li>DefaultCollectionAlias: Added a check to handle cases where another counter script running on the same collection alias removed references before this script could handle them. If the collection alias contained only one reference at quest start, this script would find it empty when it started running and would create a zero-length array on purpose, on which all subsequent operations failed. In the worst case, this could result in quests not properly advancing (Bug #25819).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04ArcadeController: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #25635).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04ArcadeNukaZapperRaceRocket: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #27228).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04ArcadeShootingGallery, DLC04:DLC04ArcadeShootingGalleryTarget: Added missing 3D checks (Bug #27306).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04KiddieKingdomMainQuestScript: Fixed a loop through a reference collection that was mistakenly using the size of a different reference collection to evaluate its end index and thus occasionally failed with 'index out of range' errors (Bug #27330).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04NukaRacersScript: Added missing 3D checks (Bug #27243).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04RideControllerAnimDrivenScript: This script did not properly update its animation state tracking variable and eventually started spilling errors because animations were called out of order. Also added missing 3D checks (Bug #27242).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04_BloatedAmbushScript: Added a missing 3D check (Bug #27342).</li>
<li>DLC06:PipboyMiscItemScript: Fixed a vanilla sanity check that was not working as intended (Bug #26196).</li>
<li>EMSystemTurfScript: Added an unbound script check to a lengthy loop through an actor array because there's evidence that the actors and/or the reference the script is running on unload while the array is processed. Also added a check to skip some code that should not run once this has happened (Bug #27421).</li>
<li>FXScatterImpactEffectsOnDeath: Improved the unbound script checks added to this script by UFO4P 2.0.3 (Bug #26237).</li>
<li>HoveringVertibirdScript: Added code to stop impact effects from being played if the parent cell detaches before the reference unloads, since this won't work in unloaded cells, irrespective of whether the reference still has 3D or not (Bug #25529).</li>
<li>MasterAmbushActorScript: Added an unbound script check to avoid occasional log spam (Bug #25693).</li>
<li>MinDestBOSScript: Added a sanity check for none objects that may be passed by workshop events after a code change on WorkshopParentScript (Bug #26238). Also added an empty handler for WorkshopEnterMenu events to avoid log spam (Bug #26236).</li>
<li>MS02PeriscopeScript: Added a quest stage check that was mentioned in a designer note but had never been added to the actual script although it was necessary for it to shut down the periscope. Without this check, the script continued to call animations on the periscope even after MS02 had been completed and the submarine had technically left the harbour. In addition, a number of missing 3D checks were added (Bug #25575).</li>
<li>PerkRootedScript: Added missing checks (Bug #27329, Bug #27404).</li>
<li>PowerArmorFXScript: Added an unbound script check (Bug #27220).</li>
<li>REObjectJS01Note: This script was missing a state change to prevent it from calling REObjectJS01 again if the player reads the note more than once (Bug #26736).</li>
<li>REScript: Added a sanity check to handle cases where non-RE quests running this script are using the RangeCheckDistance property for custom purposes. If this property is set to anything else than zero, REScript automatically tries to register for distance events with the trigger but this fails with an error on all quests that are not random encounters because they have no triggers (Bug #25354).</li>
<li>RETriggerScript: Added code to defend trigger sabotage attempts discovered on some random encounter quests added by the DLCs. The start fragments of these quests contain a separate line that runs after the startup function on REScript has been called and for no obvious reason overwrites the valid myQuest property on RETrigger Script that was previously passed by REScript with an invalid one that turns into a broken pointer once the offending quests shut down (Bug #27394).</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC03_ll_Caltrop75 incorrectly had the construction formula for Caltrop Grenades assigned when it should have been the weapon version. This caused the 2 vendors who should offer this item to have none available. (Bug #26828)</li>
<li>"Leather Coat" (Armor_Raider_Suit_02A_GlovesC) and "Traveling Leather Coat" (Armor_Raider_Suit_02B_GlovesC) should have offered up 1 leather in scrap rather than 1 cloth. They both appear to have been initially duplicated from the actual cloth Raider gloves listed above these 2 in the CK. (Bug #26717)</li>
<li>One of the two versions of the BoS Uniform (Armor_BoS_Soldier_Underarmor) didn’t yield one piece of cloth like was intended. This was due to it not being included in the appropriate FormList (modScrapRecipe_NullMelee_Cloth). (Bug #26721)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Several NPC corpses lingered at the Fort Hagen Satellite Array after the completion of Headhunting (DLC01MQ04) because the underlying control quest (DLC01FortHagenSatelliteArrayQuest) was not also stopped at the end stage. (Bug #26693)</li>
<li>3 additional NPCs need to have their shock collars removed if you complete Open Season by killing all the raiders. (Bug #25526) [NR]</li>
<li>At the end of Defend the Castle (MinDefendCastle) it was possible for Ronnie Shaw to fail to deliver the proper dialogue if the quest was against the Brotherhood of Steel. (Bug #22422)</li>
<li>At the end of Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution (MS11) the quest holding the first wave of scavenger aliases is never shut down, resulting in the corpses lingering forever. (Bug #26819)</li>
<li>When speaking to Roger Warwick for the first time, the response where the player says his wife is dead needs to be conditioned for male players because the female response is a completely incorrect line from the other dialogue branch. (Bug #25769)</li>
<li>The 3 dogs you can buy from Erikson in Far Harbor were supposed to be cleared from alias in his control quest (DLC03_ADV017) but this could not be done because those aliases were not marked optional. (Bug #26610, Bug #26509) [NR]</li>
<li>During Emergent Behavior (COMCurieQuest) the alias for her old form is unable to be cleared when called for by the script due to not being marked optional. (Bug #26551)</li>
<li>Also during Emergent Behavior the quest was attempting to remove Curie's old outfit but the command was trying to remove the outfit and not the armor item. (Bug #26550)</li>
<li>And once more during Emergent Behavior the quest is attempting to enable the player's memory chair directly instead of using the proper enable parent. (Bug #26549)</li>
<li>Several workshop radiant attacks (DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned01, DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned02, DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned03, DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned04, DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned05Starter) fail to process a check for Preston Garvey properly because they did not fill his alias property. (Bug #26412, Bug #26512)</li>
<li>Allie Filmore will continue to use her post-game dialogue at the Institute because it was not checking the conditions that should have been set to make her only say it once. (Bug #26834)</li>
<li>DLC03BostonArrivalAndDeparture - This activator is used during The Great Hunt (DLC03FarHarborS03) and is supposed to advance the quest to say the Mariner killed the Red Death if you leave the island. This was not actually able to happen due to the quest property being missing on the object. (Bug #26358)</li>
<li>Hull Breach 3 (DLC03FarHarborFF03c) should no longer keep prompting for the count on carapaces after you've obtained the 3rd one. (Bug #26826)</li>
<li>Corpses for Margaret, Russel, and Mary Sutton can disappear from the game before the player has a chance to encounter them. They were supposed to be part of an unmarked DN132 quest which was never created. We have created a substitute replacement for it that will preserve their corpses until all 3 of the avaialble notes have been read. When they have, the quest holding their aliases will shut down so the corpses can be removed afterward. (Bug #25791) [NR]</li>
<li>Anne Hargraves should no longer have topics about the radio station once she's been made a settlement trader. (Bug #26812)</li>
<li>When accessing the Wind Farm on Far Harbor, the quest (DLC03MQ06_WindFarmBuildingQuest) attempts to clear some aliases that don't need to be because the quest will be shutdown shortly afterward anyway. (Bug #26511)</li>
<li>Cleared an invalid property from DLC03MQ06_WindFarmBuildingQuest. (Bug #26510)</li>
<li>The Changing Tide (DLC03FarHarborM03) attempts to set 3 quest objectives that don't exist (700,800,900). (Bug #26487)</li>
<li>Invalid properties removed from DLC03FarHarborS01_Misc. (Bug #26486)</li>
<li>Invalid propertied removed from DLC03WorkshopRadiantOwned05. (Bug #26373)</li>
<li>Where You Belong (DLC03MQ03) attempts to set 2 quest objectives that don't exist (38,42). (Bug #26362)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid property from DLC03AcadiaM01. (Bug #26361)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid property from DLC01COMRobotCompanionBleep. (Bug #26335)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid properties from RECheckpoint02_SynthAttackers. (Bug #26205)</li>
<li>During Vision of the Future (DLC06E03) Canditate One's alias cannot be cleared as directed because it was not set to be optional. (Bug #26197) [NR]</li>
<li>Cleared invalid properties from RR302. (Bug #26184)</li>
<li>Cleared invalid property from RECheckpointMinWon05_Init. (Bug #26173)</li>
<li>MS13 [0003B2BA]: One of Darcy Pembrook's dialogue responses was only intended to play if the player character is female, but was missing the proper condition check. (Bug #26337)</li>
<li>COMDeacon [0002997E]: One of Deacon’s hellos shouldn’t have been able to play if the Brotherhood of Steel has been destroyed, but was missing the proper condition check. (Bug #26334)</li>
<li>COMOldLongfellowIdle [0300F163]: One of Old Longfellow’s idles specifically refers to it being dark outside, but was missing the proper condition check to make sure it was actually nighttime. (Bug #26411)</li>
<li>COMOldLongfellowIdle [00011E75]: One of Old Longfellow’s idles shouldn’t have been able to play outside of Far Harbor, but was missing the proper condition check. (Bug #26468)</li>
<li>COMDeacon [000F7830]: One of Deacon’s hellos doesn’t make sense if the Institute has been destroyed. (Bug #26501)</li>
<li>COMCurie [0010BA80, 0010F1DD]: Two of Curie’s dialogue topics were only intended to play if the player character is female, but were missing the proper condition check. (Bug #26564, Bug #26563)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DN054PaintJobCertificateScript: When using the Atom Cats paint job certificate to obtain the paint job, the item was set to be deleted. Inventory objects cannot be deleted in this manner so the script needed to be changed to remove it from the player's inventory after using it. (Bug #26833)</li>
<li>MinRadiantOwnedBuildResourceScript: Script is missing an event handler for WorkshopEnterMenu, resulting in unnecessary log spam. (Bug #26807)</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03BoatAnimScript: No sanity check for disabled objects before trying to run anims on them. (Bug #26488)</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03_WESafeEnableMarkerScript: Improper use of the GetParentCell() function. (Bug #26420)</li>

<li>GlowingSeaPOIJS01Script: No sanity check to make sure the second turret and protectron actually exist. (Bug #26298)</li>
<li>DLC06:WorkshopAutoRepairScript: No validation to make sure the workshop has been made ready before trying to register it for remote events. (Bug #26017)</li>
<li>BoS303LabSandboxTriggerScript: Script needs to validate whether or not Ingram's alias is actually filled before trying to get her to evaluate packages. (Bug #25850)</li>
<li>MinRadiantOwned04Script: Script was missing an event handler for WorkshopEnterMenu. (Bug #26241)</li>
<li>DN136_SynthShutdownScript: Script attempts to play an idle on an actor it already turned off AI processing on. (Bug #26189)</li>
<li>DN084_GlassElevatorScript: Several attempts to run commands on the myCageDoor property even if it doesn't exist in the elevator setup. (Bug #26187)</li>
<li>CompanionCrimeFactionHostilityScript: Several attempts to process myCrimeFaction even when it's not valid. (Bug #25840)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Slag's Terminal (DN121_BossTerminal) was missing the property to add the map marker for Dunwich Borers. (Bug #26290)</li>
<li>"Clubhouse Terminal" (DN035_ClubhouseTerminal) at Easy City Downs erroneously had "Eager Ernie's Key" (DN035_EasyCityDownsKey) assigned as the key that unlocks it. The correct key is "Eager Ernie's Password" (DN035_EasyCityDownsPassword). (Bug #26526)</li>
<li>BoS_DN130_GarageTerminal: Missing hacking holotape setting. (Bug #26566)</li>

<li>0006A048: Changed the trigger box type at Lynn Woods so that when the cell loads it triggers the quest that holds the corpse alias needed for the locked chest in the same area. (Bug #24218) [NR]</li>
<li>000F9757, 000F9758: Two beds at The Slog which were too close together and thus inaccessible. This necessitated the creation of two custom bed objects with the markers on the blocked sides disabled. They were then pulled farther apart and the navmesh adjusted to fit. (Bug #26823)</li>
<li>001A684D: Removed a useless terminal at Quincy Ruins. (Bug #26815)</li>

<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Defend The Castle (MinDefendCastle) was getting stuck and not advancing the attack waves after the first due to a bad edit to the death tracker on one of the quest aliases. (Bug #25860)</li>
<li>For reasons unknown, the animation fix for Railroad Stealth Boys was causing the game to remove a regular Stealth Boy from your inventory instead of the correct one. (Bug #26170)</li>
<li>Fixes done in TrapThistleScript have been reworked due to the fact that they appear to be leaving behind radiation traps that were deleted. This modifies Bug #23367 and Bug #20688.</li>
<li>An old edit to fix a gap at Croup Manor was breaking the precombs there and has been removed. To cover the gap, which is too large to ignore, a flat rock of sufficient size was placed to cover it instead. (Bug #26304)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Audio Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>One of Parker Quinn’s audio lines mistakenly merged the second part of the dialogue topic in with the first, which resulted in three sentences being played twice. The audio for the first part of the dialogue topic has been trimmed to fix this issue. (Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\NPCMParkerQuinn\00083F77_1.fuz) (Bug #25690)</li>
<li>Minutemen Radio audio line that had the last word partially cut off. This has been corrected by replacing it with a duplicate audio sample in the game that didn’t have this issue. (Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\NPCMMinuteMenRadioVoice\00217A93_5.fuz) (Bug #25758)</li>
<li>One of the female player character's audio lines that can play when trading with a companion didn’t match the subtitle text or the corresponding male player character’s audio line. This has been corrected by replacing it with a duplicate audio sample in the game that didn’t have this issue. (Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\PlayerVoiceFemale01\0011CD97_1.fuz) (Bug #25901)</li>
<li>Diamond City security guard audio line that would say "Really, pal. Stealing?" instead of "Really? Stealing?" like the sample for the other voice actor. It was also intended for the female player character, so having the "pal" part in the audio recording was done in error. (Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\GuardMaleDiamondCity01\000D1513_1.fuz) (Bug #25961)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Inst302SynthRoomTrigger did not have the Health property filled in as required. (Bug #25833)</li>
<li>Right Leg Barbaric Staggering Plate (DLC01Bot_Legs_Sentry_Armor_Wasteland08_Right) was missing the knockdown effect it's supposed to have to match the left leg. (Bug #25385)</li>
<li>Right Leg Warmonger Staggering Plate (DLC01Bot_Legs_Sentry_Armor_Wasteland10_Right) was missing the knockdown effect it's supposed to have to match the left leg. (Bug #25385)</li>
<li>DLC01Bot_Torso_Sentry_Shoulder_Null_Right should be labeled as "No Right Shoulder Mod" and also should not be stating it launches cluster bombs since it does no such thing. (Bug #25384)</li>
<li>LoadElevatorPanelHiTech, LoadElevatorPanelPublic, LoadElevatorPanelUtility, LoadElevatorPanelVault: these items were missing the "deactivated message" property on LoadElevatorPanelScript (Bug #25574).</li>
<li>TrapRadiation: The script on this trap was missing a property for the items to be added to the player's inventory upon disarming the trap. This fix also required a modification to TrapRadiationScript because it was expecting a MiscItem property and thus did not accept the (already existing) leveled list that specified these items (Bug #25639).</li>
<li>Child of Atom Simple Rags (ClothesChildofAtom2), Short Rags (ClothesChildofAtom3), Long Brown Rags (ClothesChildofAtomBrown), Brown Rags (ClothesChildofAtomBrown2), Short Brown Rags (ClothesChildofAtomBrown3), Long Green Rags (ClothesChildofAtomGreen), Green Rags (ClothesChildofAtomGreen2), and Short Green Rags (ClothesChildofAtomGreen3) did not return any cloth when scrapped. They should return one piece like other similar clothing items. (Bug #25995)</li>
<li>Gunner Harness (Armor_GunnerRaider_Underwear2) and Gunner Guard Outfit (Armor_GunnerGuard_UnderArmor) did not return any leather when scrapped. They should return one piece like other similar clothing items. (Bug #26078)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>WestingEstateExt, WRVRBroadcastCenterExt, Wilderness (0000E597), Wilderness (0000E598): Worldspace cells that had incorrect water type settings. (Bug #25700)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Cryolater's fusion core is inserted backward. (meshes\weapons\Cryolator\CryolatorLoad.nif, meshes\weapons\Cryolator\Cryolator_1.nif) (Bug #24743)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>If the player is kicked out of the Institute after reporting back to Father in The Battle of Bunker Hill (Inst302) the residents of Bunker Hill will be stuck in the cowering position forever because the secondary combat tracker is never shut down. (Bug #25869)</li>
<li>Invalid DN084_MassFusion02_LabWindowEnableMarker property removed from DN084. (Bug #25848)</li>
<li>Invalid DialogueInstituteLokenAyo1 property removed from InstM03. (Bug #25837)</li>
<li>Invalid DialogueInstituteLokenAyo1 property removed from InstM03Starter. (Bug #25835)</li>
<li>A scene involving Vertibirds during The Battle of Bunker Hill (Inst302Combat) was not able to complete properly because the game was trying to change the value on a global variable that had been incorrectly marked as a constant. (Bug #25830)</li>
<li>Invalid SynthPortal1 property removed from Inst302Combat. (Bug #25829)</li>
<li>Invalid property removed from MinutemenCentralQuest dialogue. (Bug #25991)</li>
<li>BoSKickOut: Flagged an alias as optional, so the scripts can clear it as intended (Bug #25723).</li>
<li>BoSM04: Fixed a null-pointer property (Bug #25722).</li>
<li>BoS301: Removed some lines from the stage 90 fragment that were referencing a non-existing objective (Bug #25692).</li>

<li>DLC04GZMainQuest: Fixed several null-pointer properties (Bug #25649).</li>
<li>DLC04MQ01: Fixed a null-pointer property (Bug #25632).</li>
<li>DLC04GZNukaGalaxy: Fixed three null-pointer properties (Bug #25650).</li>
<li>DLC04MQ01Gauntlet: Fixed an issue where the quest script tried to animate an elevator in unloaded area. The script now sets a bool on the elevator script that lets the elevator run the required animations if it loads for the next time (Bug #25645).</li>
<li>DLC04RECampCT03: Fixed three null-pointer properties (Bug #25655).</li>
<li>DNMasterQuest: Fixed an issue with the condition checks on ElevatorGoingUpDownScene that could result in the wrong announcer message being played (i.e. "going up" if the elevator was going down and vice versa) (Bug #25517).</li>
<li>FFGoodneighbor07: Fixed several lines in the quest fragments that were mistakenly calling ChangeAnimArchetype() instead of ChangeAnimFaceArchetype() to change the AnimFaceArchetypes on various actors (Bug #24838).</li>
<li>InstSynthCreation: Missing 3D check added on scene fragment SF_InstSynthCreationScene_001AC0CE (Bug #25340).</li>
<li>InstM01: Flagged an alias as optional, so the scripts can clear it as intended (Bug #25765).</li>
<li>MQ206: Fixed two null-pointer properties and removed a line from the stage 50 fragment that tried to start a non-existing scene (Bug #25337).</li>
<li>MQ302Min: Modified the fill conditions on three aliases to fix an issue where these aliases remained empty because they were setup to fill with actors from aliases on another quest that had not started running when this quest did (Bug #25420).</li>
<li>REAssaultSC15_FactionBoSvsInstRelay, REAssaultSC10_FactionMMvsInstRelay: Missing properties added on quest aliases (Bug #25699).</li>
<li>RR201: Fixed an issue in the stage 500 fragment where two script functions were called in the wrong order (Bug #25611).</li>
<li>Vault81Tour: Invalid properties removed (Bug #25544).</li>
<li>Vault81Tour: Removed an invalid property from scene TourHydroponicScene (Bug #25546).</li>

<li>Inst305Post [000FB0DF]: A hello topic with a missing condition check to make sure that Dr. Li has not left the Institute before it plays. (Bug #25867)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>PerkMagHuntsmanScript: Due to a failed safeguard and some really stupid unnecessary math operations, the script was allowing the ExtraMeatChance to drop by 100 every time the Wasteland Survival Guide #9 was activated. This caused the perk to fail to work correctly. (Bug #26274)</li>
<li>Inst302InteriorTriggerScript: No sanity check to make sure the alias is filled before being checked for a dead actor. (Bug #25870)</li>
<li>QF_Inst305_000A274B: Stage 60 is not making sure the LawrenceHiggs alias is filled before attempting to perform operations on it. (Bug #25858)</li>
<li>QF_MinVsInst_00055BE4: Stage 60 is attempting to disable a non-existent object. (Bug #25856)</li>
<li>BoS303ReactorTriggerScript: No sanity check on BoS303IngramAlias before trying to evaluate an AI pack. (Bug #25854)</li>
<li>QF_DN084_0006D646: Stage 360 is trying to shut down a scene that doesn't exist. (Bug #25853)</li>
<li>QF_InstMassFusion_0015BD39: Stage 50 is trying to complete a non-existent objective. (Bug #25851)</li>
<li>QF_MS13Thugs_000838AD: Stage 10 was attempting to enable NPCs in a reference collection but was using the wrong index values to do this. (Bug #25820)</li>
<li>DN136_RemoveRadiationTriggerScript: Script was incorrectly set up to use integers for healing radiation on the player when it should be computing it in floats. This causes fractional radiation values to fail to heal properly. (Bug #25784, Bug #24102)</li>
<li>AbLegendaryScript: Check added to avoid event registration for unbound script instances (Bug #25921).</li>
<li>DeathclawRaceScript: Checks added to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25962).</li>

<li>DLC04:DLC04RideControllerGenericScript: Removed several lines that tried to stop a sound instance which was always invalid (Bug #25634). Also added a missing 3D check (Bug #25651).</li>
<li>HackerHolotapeMaster: Added checks to stop any further actions (and avoid errors) in cases where the player inserts a holotape into a non-matching terminal (e.g. using the turret override holotape on a terminal with no turrets linked etc.) (Bug #25610).</li>
<li>InstituteTeleportQuestAliasScript: Added sanity checks for 'none' locations (Bug #25542).</li>
<li>InstKickOutQuestScript: Added a check to prevent this script from trying to delete an input enable layer that was never created (Bug #25415).</li>
<li>MQ302Script: Removed several lines that were registering for events that cannot be handled by this script (Bug #25419).</li>
<li>REScript: Check added to bail out of the dead count tracking procedures if the array required for this purpose has not been set up. This was necessary because some quests are misusing the 'Track Death' flag on the RE alias scripts to flag aliases for dead count tracking by other procedures than those provided by REScript (Bug #26106).</li>
<li>SynthCrippleMeleeScript: Checks added to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25570).</li>

<li>DLC01_TrackSystemMachine: Two lines in this script were mistakenly in the wrong order. This could result in the tracks staying inactive and the final battle in the Mechanist's Lair not starting (Bug #25620).</li>
<li>DLC03_MultiCounterAliasColIncOnDeath: Added a missing quest stage check to the function that turns on the auto-removal of dead actors, since this is needed to advance the quest in cases where that functionality is temporarily turned off. Also improved the code on DLC03MQ02FightQuestScript that toggles this functionality (Bug #25580).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.6 (2018-12-05)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The file for the power armor frame fix was in the wrong folder and thus not taking effect.</li>
<li>The pickup sounds added to Shipment_Steel_250, Shipment_Wood_250, Shipment_Rubber_large, Shipment_Ceramic_large, Shipment_Copper_large had to be restored because they had been inadvertently removed when the shipment script properties on these items were fixed (Bug #25484).</li>
<li>DLC03:FogCondenserFurnitureScript: The tracking bool added by UFO4P 2.0.1 for Bug #22143 was initialized with a wrong default value (Bug #23910).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Barney (DN083_Barney) is now essential until the player enters the trigger zone around his house, so he will no longer die for unknown reasons before his quest starts running (Bug #20438) [NR].</li>
<li>Clarabell, the named brahmin at Abernathy Farm (EncBrahminClarabell) did not respond to feeding troughs because she was never formally added to the workshop and thus never got the package to handle that (Bug #20179).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Effect Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>TeleportOutSpellEffect: Invalid property removed from TeleportSpellEffectScript (Bug #25184).</li>
<li>DLC01LvlMechProtectronPod_AbRaceProtectronEffect: Missing script properties added (Bug #24673).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>PlayerHouse_KitchenSink01Activator, PlayerHouse_Ruin_KitchenSink01Activator, Vault_Sink_01Activator, DLC06Vault_Sink_01Activator: The scripts on these objects were missing the female drinking sounds and the pointer to the Tutorial quest (Bug #23076).</li>
<li>DN015LaserEmmitter (sic, it's misspelled): Missing sound property added (Bug #21890).</li>
<li>DLC01TrackSystem_TrackDummy: Improved the fix for a missing node name from UFO4P 2.0.5 to make it apply retroactively (Bug #24678).</li>
<li>Armor_RaiderMod_Torso: The sturdy and heavy raider chest pieces did never appear in epic versions because the object templates for the epic items were mistakenly referencing the mod collections for the synth armor chest pieces instead of those for the raider armor chest pieces (Bug #25311).</li>
<li>Added a "null mod" for ballistic weave and a corresponding construction recipe, to allow the player to remove ballistic weave mods from clothing items. Some vanilla object templates have a null mod specified already but this never worked because that mod is set up to attach to a different slot (Bug #20496).</li>
<li>LL_Armor_Wastelander_Combined mistakenly returned two armors and a hat instead of selecting from the armors and combining the result with the hat (Bug #25332).</li>
<li>DLC04_PA_Material_Placeholder: Invalidated the duplicated T-51 Sugar Bombs paint job by removing its mod association keywords, so it will no longer be listed twice in the workbench menu. Items that have this mod attached already will remain unaffected (Bug #23662).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Lexington Garage: Fixed a navmesh gap and improved some navmesh sections that were buried below huge dirt piles (Bug #20323).</li>
<li>Medford Memorial Hospital: Fixed a bad navmesh section in a doorway and corrected a couple of vertices that were floating too far above the ground (#20415).</li>
<li>Ownership issues arising when the player decides to oppose Dr Chambers in MS17 (The Human Error) are now solved by adding the player to CovenantFaction once he gains control of the workshop. If siding with Dr Chambers, MS17 adds him to that faction anyway, but the quest can't do that in the other case because it shuts down before the player returns to Covenant and no one at Covenant would turn hostile if it did (Bug #20184).</li>
<li>Once the Covenant workshop is owned by the player, the doors 00020371, 000E0514, 000E0516, 000E053F, 000E0540, 000E5880 that are scripted to get relocked on reload are now swapped for non-scripted versions that do not require a key. The script that handles this swap will also disable the triggers 000786FB, 000786FC, 000786FD, 00078705, 00078718, 000E92A2 that are scripted to close the aforementioned doors once they have been opened (Bug #20369).</li>
<li>The two generic settlers (CovenantGenericF01, CovenantGenericM01) have been included in the cleanup procedure that handles disabling of the dead bodies after MS17 (Human Error) has stopped running (Bug #24468).</li>
<li>The turrets at Covenant will now be disabled on unload after they have been destroyed. Using them as workshop turrets is not possible because they are missing the scripts and all other prerequisites to make this work, so they would never add to the defense rating and could not be repaired. To give the player a reason to destroy them, their aggression and confidence data were set to aggressive and foolhardy (like all other turrets in the game), so they will attack now as one would expect it if the player fights the people at Covenant (Bug #20368).</li>
<li>Spectacle Island: The preplaced dead corpses will now be disabled when the area unloads for the first time after the player has gained control of the workshop (Bug #25297).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LS_WeaponsWorkbench01: Fixed the position of a glue bottle that was clipping with a metal case (Meshes\SCOL\Fallout4.esm\CM0022B988.nif) (Bug #23294)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>RETravelKMK03, RETravelKMK05: These quests were missing checks to prevent them from running again after the actors they made appear in roadside encounters (Smiling Larry and The Scribe) were recruited by the player (Bug #20656).</li>
<li>DialogueDiamondCity: Solomon's dialogue topics on mutated fern were mistakenly checking whether the start stage of FFDiamondCity03 was completed but this stage was never set when the player already had a fern in his inventory when Solomon asked him for mutated fern for the first time (Bug #20272).</li>
<li>RETravelSC02: Fixed an issue with the startup of this quest where manipulation of a reference in a quest alias could fail because it was done in a fragment that was running while the quest was still being initialized (Bug #23698). [NR]</li>
<li>Min02, Min03: Missing properties added (Bug #23653).</li>
<li>Min03 (Old Guns): The quest will now advance also if Sarge is deactivated with the robotics expert perk rather than killed (Bug #24121) [NR].</li>
<li>Min01: Missing properties added (Bug #23307).</li>
<li>Companions will no longer comment about mirelurk hatchlings and hermit crab spawn as if they were radroaches (Bug #19729).</li>
<li>DogmeatQuest: Invalid property removed from topic info fragment TIF_DogmeatQuest_001AB268 (Bug #23358).</li>
<li>InstM01: Removed an invalid property (Bug #25412).</li>
<li>Inst302: Corrected a quest property that was erroneously pointing to a mirelurk nest pile (Bug #25347).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastle: Cleared a flag on the attacker collection alias script that resulted in the quest trying to track death counts with the help of REScript which MinDefendCastleScript extends, although the quest has not been designed to do it that way and is also missing all other script properties needed to make this work at all. As a result, the scripts ran superfluous code and spilled an error every time an attacker was killed (Bug #25417) [NR].</li>
<li>Inst301: Added a missing property and corrected an invalid one (Bugs #25348, #25349).</li>
<li>InstR03NEW: Removed an invalid property (Bug #25414).</li>
<li>InstR05: Corrected two invalid properties (Bug #25346).</li>
<li>FFGoodneighbor08: Fixed several issues with this quest's shut down (Bug #23228) [NR].</li>
<li>REObjectRO3: Fixed an issue with the startup of this quest where starting a scene could fail because the start call came from a fragment that was running while the quest was still being initialized (Bug #23738).</li>
<li>DLC01MQ02: Removed a line from the stage 2800 fragment that tried to complete a non-existing objective (Bug #23268).</li>
<li>DN092: Added checks to scene fragment SF_DN092_BossTauntScene_0001F68D to prevent it from trying to initiate combat with dead actors (Bug #23370).</li>
<li>FFDiamondCity10: Added a line to the quest script to remove ownership of the door to the mayor's office, so it will no longer be considered a crime to open the door to confront McDonough (Bug #23864) [NR].</li>
<li>FFDiamondCity12: Fixed an issue where this quest tried to set a stage on an event-scoped quest without previously checking whether it was even running (Bug #23091).</li>
<li>MQ102: Removed a line from the stage 55 fragment that tried to complete a non-existing objective (Bug #23368).</li>
<li>RRR01b: Removed a line from the stage 100 fragment that never worked and always threw an error because the reference it tried to enable is always in a container when this fragment runs (Bug #24550).</li>
<li>RRR03: Compiled an OnLocationChange event that lived on the quest fragment script but was not part of any fragment down to a stub because it never worked. It was also not needed because it was supposed to shut down the quest when a specific stage was set but that stage stopped the quest anyway (Bug #25161).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LightbulbOnOffScript: This script is handling animated light sources but also runs on objects that are not animated at all. As had to be expected, those references are permanently spilling errors because all animation-related script operations fail on them. Added a property that allows the script to discern whether the object it's running on is animated or not and to skip all animation-related operations if it's not. Set this to 'true' by default and changed it to 'false' on PlayerHouse_Lamp01Off because this is the only unanimated object this script is running on (Bug #24769).</li>
<li>AssaultronHeadModScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25206).</li>
<li>BloodbugScript: This script controls the bloodbugs' blood sacks but was mistakenly using the actor value for the bloodbugs' legs to do this. Also fixed an issue where the script forgot to re-register for animation events on reload and a badly constructed condition check that could result in casting a spell while there was no target around (Bug #25160).</li>
<li>BoSM01DistressPulserAliasScript: Added a check to skip some operations if the pulser is in a container, as they would fail otherwise (Bug #24191).</li>
<li>Also added some code to disable the corresponding transmitter if the pulser is scrapped at a workshop (Bug #20314) [NR].</li>
<li>COMDeaconScript: Added numerous missing sanity checks (Bug #25146).</li>
<li>CompanionActorScript: Added checks to prevent this script from trying to initialize and update affinity data for workbench-built robots, since these are missing all properties to handle this (Bug #22122). This will also stop the log spam from Ada (Bug #25194).</li>
<li>CryoCorpseScript: Check added to prevent this script from running on disabled references (Bug #22275).</li>
<li>DefaultCollectionAlias: Modified this script to work around an engine bug that may turn zero length arrays into none arrays upon reload (Bug #23739).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_EyebotSelfDestructScript, RobotSelfDestructScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effects these scripts are running on expire. Also added a check for invalid soundIDs to DLC01:DLC01_EyebotSelfDestruct Script (Bug #25204).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_MechanistDoorControlScript: modified this script to avoid unnecessary script activity and animation graph errors (Bug #24653).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_MechanistDoorScript: improved 3D checking (Bug #24653).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_TrackSystemMachine: Added various sanity checks and fixed an issue where this script forgot to save the ref of a spawned object in the corresponding script variable (Bug #25199).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_Dispatcher: Added a few lines of code to make sure that an array is properly initialized before this script tries to add elements to it (Bug #25211).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_LaserTripwireScript: Added a check to prevent this script from disarming traps that were disarmed already as this only resulted in unnecessary script activity and a wall of animation graph errors on the papyrus log (Bug #25201).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01MQ00Script: If DLC01 was running from game start, this script was failing its initialization because it tried to access the workshops array on WorkshopParentScript before the workshops had been initialized. It will now wait for stage 20 to be set on WorkshopParent quest (this stage is set once the workshop initialization is complete) before it starts running its own initialization functions (Bug #23355).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01SentryBotOverheatFXScript: Added checks to bail out if the magic effect this script is running on expires (Bug #25205).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03BoatAnimScript: Modified this script to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #23909).</li>
<li>DLC03:DLC03MQ02FightQuestScript: Corrected a line that tried to remove a 'none' from an alias but actually wanted to remove a reference that is not an actor. Also fixed a threading issue that led to errors because an external script was removing references from an alias collection while this script was looping through it. The latter fix also required a modification to DLC03:DLC03_MultiCounterAliasColIncOnDeath (Bug #23912).</li>
<li>DLC03:FarHarborFF02CondenserScript, DLC03:FarHarborFF02Condenser02Script, DLC03:DLC03FarHarborFF02Condenser03Script: Modified these scripts to stay inactive once the refs they're running on have been disabled. At this point in the game, these refs are no longer needed but the scripts superfluously continued to run their OnLoad and OnUnload events. The modifications also fix animation graph errors (Bug #23915).</li>
<li>DLC03:TrapBear: Fixed an issue where the script changed states too slowly to effectively skip trigger events while a previous event was still being handled (#24385).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04HubFF01PlayerAliasScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23352).</li>
<li>DLC04:DLC04HubTradersLoseCollars: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23353).</li>
<li>DLC05:WeaponRackScript: Fixed a thread lock (Bug #2533).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: Added a check to bail out if this script is called before its terminal property has been initialized, as it would otherwise fail all of its operations (Bug #23381). Also improved the UFO4P 2.0.5 fix for certain companions being displayed before the player even met them (Bug #24636).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06OverseerHandlerScript: This script had to be substantially modified to fix some major bugs:
 <ul>
  <li>The terminal could operate on invalid data, because it could access the workshop data at any time. To avoid this, the sensitive terminal functions will no longer be displayed now until the workshop reset has finished running.</li>
  <li>Due to wrong syntax in a condition check, the assignment of settlers to guard duty or farming never worked.</li>
  <li>Even with that check fixed, the terminal would not have properly completed the assignment tasks because the game interpreted the terminal access as the player leaving the workshop, and all checks for the workshop being loaded returned false while the terminal was used. Consequently, the scripts did never update the workshop ratings to reflect the terminal operations because workshop resource recalculations are not possible if a workshop is not loaded. This is usually corrected by subsequent workshop resets, but in the meantime, the player would potentially be left with wrong workshop resource data.</li>
  <li>The terminal did never clear its workshop data. This made a very large number of references needlessly persistent and also could cause problems down the line when any of these objects was scrapped.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>DN015PuzzleScript: Added a check to prevent this script from trying to evaluate text replacement data for missing samples (Bug #21917).</li>
<li>DN017QuestScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #23491).</li>
<li>DN029CannonMasterScript: Added a tracking bool to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24175).</li>
<li>DN079_CanneryLidScript: Compiled the OnCellAttach() event down to a stub because it always tried to move the lid into a position it was already in. The only noticeable effect of this operation was a wall of errors on the papyrus log (Bug #23255).</li>
<li>DN131_SwanAliasScript: Checks added to prevent this script from moving Swan while he has no 3D or his parent cell is not attached, since this would fail with errors otherwise (Bug #22274).</li>
<li>DN158SubDoorLightController: Added several checks to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24492).</li>
<li>ElevatorMasterScript: Added five missing checks for valid sound instances (Bug #25218).</li>
<li>EMSystemTurfScript: improved 3D checking (Bug #24090).</li>
<li>FireFightStall_ActorScript: Check added to prevent this script from trying to enable deleted actors (Bug #23768).</li>
<li>FollowersScript: added some code to the SetAutonomy() function to clear the object array once it is overflowing and to log the objects that are potentially causing this issue (Bug #23394).</li>
<li>Hardcore:HC_JetUseScript: Added a check to prevent this script from calling the hardcore manager while survival mode is not turned on (Bug #23952).</li>
<li>IDCardReaderScript: Added a tracking bool to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24045).</li>
<li>Inst301Script: Corrected two off-by-one errors (Bug #25344).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastleAttackScript: Fixed an inappropriate check for the length of an array that always resulted in an error being thrown (Bug #25418).</li>
<li>MinDefendCastleScript: Added empty event handlers to avoid errors during the initialization of the MinDefendCastle quest (Bug #25416).</li>
<li>MirelurkHatchableScript: Modified this script to disallow handling of OnActivate events while a previous activation is still being processed, as this did result in errors being thrown. Also fixed an infinite reset loop issue (Bug #22299).</li>
<li>MQ101KelloggSequenceScript: Missing 3D check added (Bug #25303).</li>
<li>MQ101RadScannerTriggerScript: Modified this script to disallow animation calls while the references controlled by this script are still busy animating, since they would otherwise fail and throw errors (Bug #23350).</li>
<li>MQ203BabyScript: Fixed an issue with animation graph errors that were caused by conflicting animation calls from this script and MQ203Script (Bug #25305).</li>
<li>MQ203Script: Added numerous checks to prevent this script from running operations on disabled actors and calling animations on disabled references (Bug #25214).</li>
<li>MrHandyFXScript: Added a check to bail out if the effect this script is running on expires (Bug #24193).</li>
<li>MrHandyScript: Missing 3D checks added (Bug #24652).</li>
<li>TrapThistleScript: Removed a line that tried to delete a reference that is deleted by the engine already before the script gets to this point (Bug #23367).</li>
<li>TrapTrigPlate: Removed a line from this script that could lead to unnecessary recursions of the functions that handle the trigger events (Bug #23578).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript:
 <ul>
  <li>The ProduceFood() function has been rewritten again to use a new algorithm that is significantly faster than the vanilla one (Bug #24735).</li>
  <li>A bug in the object unassignment procedures was fixed that could result in objects that exceeded an actor's allowed production limit being not properly unassigned (Bug #25439).</li>
  <li>Improvements to the resource assignment procedures (Bugs #25483, #25264).</li>
  <li>Improvements to the code that handles unassignment of actors from unloaded workshops (Bug #25238).</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where objects were not properly unassigned from settlers that were sent to another workshop (Bug #25237).</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the workshop reset did not start running as expected when returning to a workshop after a previous reset was stopped prematurely (Bug #25221).</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopObjectScript: ongoing performance improvements (Bug #25215).</li>
<li>WorkshopResourceScannerScript: Added 3D checks (Bug #24091).</li>
<li>WorkshopScript: Added a check to prevent this script from passing invalid actors to WorkshopParentScript (Bug #25195).</li>
<li>WorkshopTutorialScript: Due to an inappropriate condition check, the "Damaged Object Tutorial" could be started for objects which the player cannot repair and would then never stop to display the "Repair a damaged object" message until the player entered menu mode at a different workshop and started activities that resulted in workshop events being sent (Bug #25243).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>NativeSpotlightTerminal, NativeTurretTerminal: added checks to prevent the spotlight or turret control menus from being displayed on terminals with no spotlights or turrets linked (Bug #20518).</li>
<li>HackerTurretHolotapeSubMenu: The 'Override Alliance Parameters' option on this terminal adds text replacement data that apparently survive cell resets. As a result, previously hacked terminals may display wrong alliance data if the player returns after their cell has reset. The script also may change faction ownership on individual turrets and these changes are known to survive cell resets too. To solve this, a helper quest has been added to store the data from hacked terminals. The terminal script will pass the turret data to that quest before it modifies them, and the quest will restore them once the terminal resets (Bug #22567).</li>
<li>DN006_BossTerminal: Added a missing property and removed an invalid one (Bug #23767).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair_ENT_DeconControlTerminal_ArchControlSubTerminal: Invalid property removed from fragment TERM_DLC01LairENT_DeconHallC_01008B17 (Bug #25200).</li>
<li>TERM_DN083_SubTerminalPassword: Missing sanity checks added (Bug #23317).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>01000D79: Removed two scripts from this reference that were supposed to manipulate a linked reference which does not exist (Bug #24949).</li>
<li>001A75C1: Turret missing a link to the terminal it's visually connected to (Bug #22394).</li>
<li>00184437: Load door mistakenly set as owned by Nick Valentine (Bug #23627).</li>
<li>00212A20, 0021FD4B, 0023954D, 00249097: Duplicated or otherwise obsolete triggers that have been permanently disabled (Bug #25182).</li>
<li>000E4D9D: A trigger used as marker by an AI package, but with a script running that tries to manipulate a linked reference which does not exist. To avoid log spam, the unused script has been removed (Bug #25182).</li>
<li>0012B940: This trigger was supposed to disable two leveled deathclaws to prevent them from being seen floating on the sides of a building west of Faneuil Hall, but this never worked because the links were set up backwards. This fix also required a modification to DefaultEnableDisableTrigScript because it could not handle more than one linked ref per trigger (Bug #21908).</li>
<li>0013038C: A bathroom scale trap that was placed a bit too deep underwater to allow for an activation. Increased its size a little, so as to raise the trigger surface above the water plane (Bug #23752).</li>
<li>00183281, 0018328C: Properties modified on AttractionObjectScript to avoid errors if the script tries to enable or disable these references (Bug #25203).</li>
<li>0023D713: Sleeping bag in the same place as a mattress from a random encounter spot. The sleeping bag will now remain disabled while the mattress is enabled (Bug #23646).</li>
<li>00019B16: Disabled this trigger as it is running a script that tries to start a non-existing scene (Bug #23857).</li>
<li>001A583E: A bed at Covenant that was unusable by settlers because it was missing its WorkshopObjectScript (Bug #24951). [NR]</li>
<li>00222E9F, 00222EA0: Protectron and its pod in Lexington Garage moved to avoid clipping with a bollard that pushed the unconscious protectron out of the pod. Also updated the navmesh to account for these changes (Bug #20323).</li>
<li>Added a wall piece to cover a gap between walls 0178A1F and 0178A2A (Bug #23642).</li>
<li>0022F7BF: Misplaced robot corpse. (Bug #20449)</li>

<li>Fixed an unforeseen issue with the security door in the Mechanist's Lair that was causing it to not open under certain conditions. (Bug #25189)</li>
<li>Reverted the fix for Raider torso armors specifying 01-06 variants as the actual meshes are all the same type with only visual differences that don't matter.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.5 (2018-09-08)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Removed the Guard Gutsy voice fix after it was determined that the robots are invisible for anyone who begins a new game and visits General Atomics Galleria with the fix in place. (Bug #24628)</li>
<li>Precomb data was accidentally disabled on a cell at The Castle. (Bug #25055)</li>
<li>The edit locks added by previous UFO4P versions to certain functions on WorkshopParentScript have been re-evaluated, and the locks on the following functions have been removed (Bug #24643)

  <li>WoundActor (regression of UFO4P 2.0 Bug #21898)</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Protectron in Virgil's Lab had an invalid set of script properties set on it. (Bug #24910)</li>
<li>Dead guards inside Parsons State Insane Asylum were being labeled as Gunners due to an incorrect template setting. (Bug #24944)</li>
<li>LvlBloodbugAmbush, LvlBloodbugInt and LvlBloodbugIntAmbush were missing a property on BloodbugScript (Bug #25148).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>

<li>Bourbon was using the wrong version of the put down sound for bottles. (Bug #24739)</li>
<li>Antibiotics and Curie's Health Pack were not properly flagged as ObjectTypeStimpak. (Bug #24738)</li>
<li>MS10_RadioTowerNote: Property not set on the book record, resulting in an error when trying to add a map marker. Nearest logicial location based on the note's content is the Coast Guard Pier across the river from it, so the script will now set this marker when the book is read. (Bug #24619) [NR]</li>
<li>Overdue book tokens should be using the drop sound that matches the pickup sound originally assigned in another bugfix. (Bug #23123)</li>
<li>Mr Handy Buzz Blades were yielding no scrap when they should return 1 aluminum. (Bug #24908)</li>
<li>The control item used for the track system in the Mechanist's Lair was not properly setting up the Arc tank bot due to incorrectly set script properties. (Bug #24678)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Echo Lake Lumber Mill was not set with the Far Harbor world location as its parent. This could lead to incorrectly assigned radiant quests that should go to the Commonwealth instead. It may also have played a part in settlers leaving for Dalton Farm at random times. (Bug #24586)</li>
<li>Dunwich Borers was not correctly flagged as part of its own location. At the same time, Hugo's Hole nearby was mistakenly flagged as being part of the Dunwich Borers location. (Bug #24668)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Mesh Fixes</u></b>

</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>It should no longer be possible for PAM to give out Railroad radiant quests if she's been reprogrammed for the Brotherhood of Steel. (Bug #20000)</li>
<li>Invald properties on DN053 have been removed or corrected. (Bug #24909)</li>
<li>Emogene Takes a Lover (MS09Mission02) was possible to get stuck because the aliases in The Secret of Cabot House (MS09) were not marked to allow reservations, which was blocking her from filling the required alias. All 3 of her aliases (why she has 3, who knows) have been marked to allow reserved so that this quest will no longer get itself stuck. (Bug #24814) [NR]</li>
<li>The above fix in 24814 also resolved a scripting error that comes up in MS09 when Emogene is being moved to the amphitheater. (Bug #24774) [NR]</li>
<li>In Atom Cats Garage (DN054) Zeke has 4 AI packages that have script records attached but the script files themselves don't exist, and apparently never did. (Bug #24759)</li>
<li>Corrected an invalid alias property in DLC01LairJB. (Bug #24669)</li>
<li>During Long Road Ahead (COMMacCreadyQuest) when you are told to take MacCready to Med-Tek Research, no quest marker is added to show where the location is despite him telling you where to find it. (Bug #24926)</li>
<li>DN119Fight: The second scavenger in the Rotten Landfill site encounter did never attack the mole rats because his alias was not registered on DN119FightController script (Bug #25130).</li>
<li>MQ206: Null pointer property corrected (Bug #24617).</li>
<li>The player should no longer be able to tell Dima they are a member of the Brotherhood of Steel if they have not actually joined yet. (Bug #25030)</li>
<li>COMCaitQuest: Once started, this quest could advance up to stage 50 without Cait being anywhere around, because an event and several triggers did not run a follower check. This fix also required modifications to DefaultQuestChange LocationScript (Bug #24694).</li>
<li>DLC01FortHagenSatelliteArray: Added a klaxon that was expected by this quest, but did not exist, to Fort Hagen satellite array and pointed the respective quest property to the new object (Bug #24547).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair: Flagged an alias collection as optional, so the quest script can clear it (Bug #25144).</li>
<li>DLC01Lair: Fixed calls to several doors in the stage 200 fragment as they didn't work if these doors were not loaded, and modified DLC01Lair_SecurityDoorLightScript to skip calls of an unsafe workaround in the stage 201 fragment that caused threading issues on the door scripts and performance issues because all safety lights did needlessly try to open all of the doors on every cell reload (Bug #24675).</li>
<li>DN083_Barney: invalid quest objective corrected on topic info fragment TIF_DN083_Barney_001243EA (Bug #24580).</li>

<li>MS11: Missing checks for valid sound IDs added to the stage 1399 fragment (Bug #24621).</li>
<li>MS16: Removed several lines from the stage 65 fragment that were referencing a non-existing objective. Also fixed several errors in the stage 18 and stage 200 fragments (Bugs #24836 and #24837).</li>
<li>RR102: Modified the quest script to set a bool property on an elevator instead of trying to manipulate it directly, which never worked because the elevator is not loaded while the respective fragments are running (Bug #24634).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>GenericBrawlAlliesScript, GenericBrawlPlayerScript, GenericBrawlOpponentAliasScript, MS13IntroBrawlAliasScript: Prevented "magic" effects from causing brawls to turn into real fights. Should eliminate problems from a few of the DLC effects. (Bug #24817)</li>
<li>QF_DN054_00048516: Script attempts to remove alias data from a reference after it's already been cleared from the alias. Obviously this cannot be done. (Bug #24761)</li>
<li>QF_RRR04_000B26C2: Attempting to set a persist location on a non-created reference (Bug #24971)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: If a NONE is passed to the DisarmTrigger function, several errors are set off because of a lack of sanity checking. Automatron intentionally sends a NONE for several references using this script via DLC01:DLC01Lair_LaserTripwireScript. (Bug #24679)</li>
<li>BugSwarmFXScript: Moved a function call out of the OnInit event since that function would fail to run if OnInit fired before cell attach (Bug #24771).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_TrackSystemTrapElectricArc: fixed an issue where this script failed to avaluate a target because trigger events running at the same time were modifying the array the target evaluation was running on (Bug #24676).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01LairQuestScript fixed an issue where the MBattle_Phase2_Dispatch1230() function passed an invalid argument that caused array index out of range errors down the line (Bug #24677).</li>
<li>MQ206Script: check added to prevent this script from trying to complete non-existing objectives (Bug #24620).</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: removed a superfluous call of the HandleDestruction() function (Bug #24642).</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: this script did not properly initialize and update the actor value that controls the flora harvest time. As a result, crops could regrow faster than intended, and destroyed crops could regrow immediately after their repair (Bug #24775).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: removed a superfluous check for caravan actors from the AssignObjectToWorkshop() function that was left from test runs on the UFO4P 2.0.4 modifications (Bug #24596).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: added safety measures to circumvent an engine issue that causes zero-length arrays to turn into none arrays on reload. As a result, object assignment procedures could temporarily break at a workshop if a save made at that workshop was reloaded (Bug #24603).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: auto assignment of actors to unassigned resource objects should not run on Dogmeat (Bug #24638).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: fixed a threading issue with the processing of custom workshop events that could result in quests listening to those events (e.g. minutemen quests) advancing prematurely or not progressing at all if two or more of these quests were active at the same time (Bug #24650).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopObjectScript: further modifications to improve performance (Bug #24637).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopScript: improved the cleanup procedures for work objects of actors that were unassigned while a workshop was not loaded, including support for sending custom workshop events (Bug #25129).</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopEventsQuestScript: improved the processing of custom workshop events to limit the number of calls of event handling functions on WorkshopParentScript and thus save performance (Bug #25128).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01Lair_SecurityDoorLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24654).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_RobotLiftLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors (Bug #24670).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01LairQuestScript: Fixed an off-by-one error in the CleanupDungeon() function (Bug #24671).</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01RadiantQuestScript: Fixed an issue where Enable() and AddItem() were called in the wrong order (Bug #24536).</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: Fixed an issue where this script used a wrong message object for text replacement (Bug #24636).</li>
<li>Default2StateActivator: Further modifications were needed to handle cases where a door can be activated by a reference in another cell (i.e. if OnActivate fires while the door is not loaded) (Bug #25149).</li>
<li>DN051_DelayedAmbushScript: Added checks to bail out after losing the reference of the actor this script is supposed to run on. This appears to happen if that actor is desintegrated (Bug #24428).</li>
<li>ElevatorMasterScript: Added a hidden property and some code to allow external scripts for making an elevator non-funtional even if the reference is in an unloaded area (Bug #24634).</li>
<li>FallingRocksandDustActivatorScript: Check added to skip trigger events while a previous event is still running, as this led to animations being called out of order and errors being thrown (Bug #24425).</li>
<li>FusionGeneratorSCRIPT: Added sanity checks for missing linked lights because some generators in the game are missing them inentionally (Bug #24548).</li>
<li>GlowingKlaxonLightScript: Added animation state tracking to avoid animation graph errors, and added a check to prevent the script from trying to animate disabled references (Bug #24534).</li>
<li>LegendaryArmorMagicEffectDisarmScript: Missing sanity check added (Bug #24614).</li>
<li>RR101CenterActivator: Removed a line that tried to access a non-existing object (Bug #24633).</li>
<li>ToggleButtonScript: Check added to handle conflicting calls from external scripts. Also imrpoved 3D checking (Bug #23232).</li>
<li>TrapBase: Check added to prevent this script from running on disabled traps (Bug #23933).</li>
<li>TrapBreakableWalkway: Added sanity checks for a missing linked reference since there is at least one trap existing in the game that is intentionally missing this reference (Bug #24616).</li>
<li>VertibirdTurretScript: fixed an issue where one function could clear a reference while another function was trying to run operations on it (Bug #24433).</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Invalid properties removed from DN070_HolotapeCarlTerminal. (Bug #24691)</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.4 (2018-05-26)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Reverted the edit to the north marker in Vault 88. Internal signs are wrong and there is no correct one to exchange to make things right, so undoing the marker edit was easier. (Bug #24219)</li>
<li>Removed the fix to a property on topic info fragment TIF_RECamp02_0003D617 (UFO4P 2.0.3 Bug #23162) because it broke the dialogue. To eliminate log spam, the affected topic info fragment has been compiled down to a stub instead. (Bug #23997)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Eve did not drop a synth component when killed even though she is a synth. (Bug #24346)</li>
<li>Roger Warwick did not drop a synth component when killed even though he is a synth. (Bug #24323)</li>
<li>Arlen Glass and Deirdre were not flagged as protected. (Bug #24416)</li>
<li>LCharBloatfly, LCharViciousDog and LCharViciousDogAlpha were missing the 'calculate for each item in count' and 'calculate from all levels <= player's level' flags. (Bug #24229)</li>
<li>Mutant Hounds being sold by Erickson should not be damaging the player with radiation. (Bug #24006)</li>
<li><s>Guard Gutsy robots at the General Atomics Galleria have no voices.</s> [UFO4P 2.0.5] (Bug #24043)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Animation Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Railroad version of the Stealth Boy did not have proper activation animations like the normal one does. (Bug #23859)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Audio Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Eddie Winter's line when the player confronts him in Long Time Coming lacked a female response line and was defaulting to a male line. (Bug #24125)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Effect Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Sabotaging turrets would routinely fail due to the controlling effect being marked as a spell instead of an ability. (Bug #24248)</li>
<li>abRadstagRaceEffect: The script on this effect was using the wrong actor value to make radstags aggressive. The respective script property has been modified to point to aggression instead of confidence. (Bug #23270)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Violent (mod_Legendary_Weapon_DamageLimbRecoil) is described as giving 25% to damage and limb damage but is actually set to give 30 limb damage. This should have been set to 25 as the description calls for. (Bug #24339)</li>
<li>Reduced the weight of Tato Flowers (TatoWild) from 0.5 to 0.1 units to be consistent with other flowers and blossoms in the game. (Bug #23923)</li>
<li>Two versions of the Vault 88 Jumpsuit (DLC06Armor_Vault88_UnderwearClean, DLC06Armor_Vault88_Underwear_Dirty) have no value. This is inconsistent with all others in the game which have a value of 20. (Bug #23969)</li>
<li>Armor_MiningHelmet was missing naming rules to discern the eight color variants. (Bug #24501)</li>
<li><s>Armor_RaiderMod_Torso was missing naming rules to discern the six light torso variants. (Bug #24258)</s> [UFO4P 2.0.5a]</li>
<li>Armor_VaultTecSecurity111, Armor_VaultTecSecurity111_Clean, Armor_VaultTecSecurity81 and Armor_VaultTecSecurityCovenant had no instance naming rules specified. (Bug #24321)</li>
<li>FallingDust activator: missing impact data set property added on FallingRocksAndDustActivatorScript. (Bug #24421)</li>
<li>FollowersCompanionVertibirdSnapIntoPackage: 3D check missing on package fragment. (Bug #24358)</li>
<li>LL_Armor_Forged_Helmets: this list mistakenly contained a torso armor item. (Bug #24330)</li>
<li>Package BoSPAScenePASoldierTravelPackageExit: invalid property removed from package fragment. (Bug #24189)</li>
<li>Shipment_steel_250, shipment_wood_250, shipment_rubber_large, shipment_ceramic_large, shipment_copper_large, DLC02shipment_Concrete_100 and DLC02shipment_Concrete_200 had wrong scrap amounts specified on ShipmentScript. (Bug #24505)</li>
<li>Strong's super mutant chains are not intended to be equipped by the player. (Bug #23734)</li>
<li>T-51 Power Armor was not set up correctly to change the look of the "A" level pieces. (Bug #23972)</li>
<li>Nuka-World weapons with rocket attachments are missing the proper idles and swing sounds. (Bug #24046)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>No north markers are present inside Vault 81. (Bug #24124) [NR]</li>
<li>TrinityTowerLocation: world location marker incorrectly pointing to TrinityPlazaMapMarkerRef. (Bug #24195)</li>
<li>Outpost Zimonja had its world location marker pointing to Abernathy Farm instead of the marker intended for it at the outpost itself. This resulted in NPCs such as the Caretaker not staying there when they should and ending up trying to get to Abernathy Farm instead. (Bug #20865) [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Fruit would not disappear when harvesting wild mutfruit. (meshes\landscape\plants\FloraMutFruit02Wild.nif) (Bug #24337)</li>
<li>It was not possible to harvest wild razorgrain due to missing collision on the object. (meshes\landscape\plants\WildRazorgrain01.nif) (Bug #24336)</li>
<li>Baseballs had too large a collision block on them which results in floating objects. (meshes\Props\Baseball.nif) (Bug #23628)</li>
<li>Armor\DCGuardMOutfitGO.nif did not accept material swaps because it had no material name specified. (meshes\Armor\DCGuardMOutfitGO.nif) (Bug #20300)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Father's speech during Institutionalized (MQ207) will claim you got help from the wrong faction to teleport into the Institute. This should now be corrected to check to see who actually helped you teleport in, not just which factions you may have joined as tokens early in the game. (Bug #24406)</li>
<li>At the end of Duty or Dishonor (BoSM02, BoSM02Postquest) the game needs to determine what to do with Clarke. It appears as though making a GetRef() call during the stage that is starting the quest can result in the call failing and passing a None along to the remainder of the fragment. This then results in several failures in dealing with where to move Clarke to. An added timer event should prevent this from happening again but obviously cannot fix things if this part of the game has already been completed. (Bug #24383)</li>
<li>Incorrect dialogue conditions allowed two female responses in the male branch during Piper's interview with the player in Diamond City. (Bug #24178)</li>
<li>After killing the courser in Hunting the Hunter (DLC03AcadiaM02) every NPC the player tries to speak to will result in the player simply saying "Hey, Dejen" until the quest is completed. The greeting in the quest needed a target to make sure that prompt only ran when the NPC is Dejen. (Bug #24096) [NR]</li>
<li>Diamond City Security officers would sometimes comment about it being a "nice night" during the daytime due to an incorrect condition check on a dialogue topic. (Bug #23818)</li>
<li>BoS201: removed several lines from the quest script that referenced non-existing objectives on this and other quests. (Bugs #24024, #24434)</li>
<li>BoS201: removed a line that tried to enable an enable-parented guard whose enable parent was already enabled by an earlier running stage of this quest. (Bug #24356)</li>
<li>BoS201: added a line to the stop stage fragment to remove BoS201RadioScene from the scene array on DNMasterQuest, in order to avoid log spam from RadioFailsafeScript. (Bug #24055)</li>
<li>BoS201: added a line to the scene fragment SF_BoS201_02_VertibirdFlight_00121F31 to wait for 3D before calling an animation on the Prydwen's vertibird perch. (Bug #24126)</li>
<li>BoS201, MQ106: fixed an issue with a door inside Fort Hagen which MQ106 tried to open after BoS201 disabled it. This door will now be handled by MQ106. The line to disable it has been removed from the script of BoS201. (Bug #24039)</li>
<li>BoSEnable: fixed issues with animation graph errors thrown by two doors at Boston Airport which this quest tried to open while the player was at Fort Hagen. Also removed a line that tried to enable an enable-parented ref whose parent was already enabled by an earlier stage of this quest. (Bug #24021)</li>
<li>BoSM00: null pointer property corrected on scene fragment SF_BoSM00_Kells_Intro_Initia_00142F87. (Bug #24381)</li>
<li>BoSM02: corrected three null pointer properties. (Bug #24374)</li>
<li>BoSR03: fixed an issue where a quest fragment could set the stop stage before it had finished all operations on the quest aliases. (Bug #24475)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ00: removed invalid properties and restored missing ones. (Bug #23356)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ01: script property modified to point to an enable marker instead of to a ref that is enable-parented to that marker. (Bug #23911)</li>
<li>DLC03MQ02Fight: several quest aliases flagged as optional so the quest script can clear them. (Bug #23914)</li>
<li>DN015: missing property added on scene fragment SF_DN015_RewardScene_0002CC45. (Bug #23989)</li>
<li>DN033: several quest aliases flagged as optional so the quest script can clear them. (Bug #23932)</li>

<li>FFDiamondCityWanted04: invalid script properties removed. (Bug #23901)</li>
<li>MinRecruit02: invalid property removed from topic info fragment TIF_MinutemenCentralQuest_000A02BC. (Bug #23802)</li>
<li>MQ106Investigations: added a script property for a can trap (refID 00137C61) that was mistakenly enable-parented to MQ106InvestigationItemsMarker (this left the trap non-functional), unlinked the trap from the marker, and added a line to the quest script to enable the trap separately. (Bug #24016)</li>
<li>MQ201: null pointer property corrected. (Bug #24022)</li>
<li>MS01: object reference property mistakenly pointing to a random encounter quest. Also corrected a null pointer property. (Bug #24093)</li>
<li>MS01: corrected a quest stage fragment that referenced the wrong objective on quest MS01MiscObj. (Bug #24495)</li>
<li>MS02: corrected three quest stage fragments that referenced a non-existing objective. (Bug #24476)</li>
<li>MS10b: the trigger alias on this quest could be filled with a leveled supermutant because the trigger's LocRefType was not unique. Which reference ended up in the alias at quest start was entirely random. (Bug #24115)</li>
<li>MS10b: removed two superfluous animation calls on the power lift doors that always failed with animation graph errors because the doors had already been moved in the correct position by DN161PowerLiftButton script. (Bug #24116)</li>
<li>MS11: added a missing sound property. (Bug #24418)</li>
<li>REAssaultKMK_MQ101: an encounter with named feral ghouls that should not have been repeatable. (Bug #24012)</li>

<li>The alias for the Vault-Tec Rep was not set to protected status on WorkshopParent. (Bug #24488)</li>
<li>Several of X6-88's idle comments were referencing the wrong target for gender specific dialogue checks. (Bug #23930)</li>
<li>Living on the Edge (DLC03FarHarborM02) tries to set invalid objectives during the quest. (Bug #23913)</li>
<li>To the Mattresses (RRR08) is missing the sound for completing the quest, and two dialogues are missing conditions for the status of the quest when completed. (Bug #24310)</li>
<li>Erikson uses incorrect dialogue for the player when Longfellow is with you due to the gender check being done on Erikson instead of the player. (Bug #24351)</li>
<li>WorkshopSynthInfiltrator01: this quest could not be completed due to the infiltrators never becoming hostile because the quest cleared their alias before a subsequent stage could update their faction relationships. (Bug #24539)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>WorkshopSynthAttackScript: was missing a check for the quest this script was called from, which resulted in leaving the player only one game hour to react after the attack notification had been displayed. (Bug #24537)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: No check for validity of the companion alias before doing distance calculations on them. (Bug #24424)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: AddItem will remove the reference from its existing container before putting it in the new one. The line prior to the call moving the Deathclaw egg back into the nest has been commented out as it is not needed. (Bug #24423)</li>
<li>Fragments:Quests:QF_MS05B_0014B717: Several stages attempting to complete Objective 100, which does not exist. (Bug #24422)</li>
<li>AttractionObjectScript: corrected a check for deleted references in the OnLoad() event to bail out if a reference is deleted instead of continuing to process the event which then started to throw errors. (Bug #24413)</li>
<li>BehemothSlamsFXScript: checks added to prevent the script from running after the magic effect has expired. (Bug #20619)</li>
<li>BirdCritterScript: further modifications to reduce glitches with birds and to improve performance. (#24367)</li>
<li>BoS302_DisableFastTravelTrigger: missing sanity check. (Bug #23860)</li>
<li>BoSKellsPAScript: did not check whether the parent quest was running before it tried to start a scene. (Bug #24372)</li>
<li>BoSVBAliasBoardingScript: missing a check for a non-existing passenger alias, since at least one of the quests that have this script attached to a vertibird alias handle the boarding procedure on a separate script and do not have a passenger alias. (Bug #24357)</li>
<li>DefaultClearLocationOnTriggerScript: added a bool property to specify whether the trigger should disable itself after the script has run because some triggers running this script have their enable state controlled by enable parents. (Bug #24415)</li>
<li>DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad: corrections made to prevent this script from trying to run operations on deleted references. (Bug #24194)</li>
<li>DefaultStartSceneOnActivate: did not check whether the parent quest was running before it tried to start a scene. (Bug #24278)</li>
<li>DLC01:DLC01_CompanionSelfDestructScript: OnInit() event missing a line to initialize a script property. Also added a check for a valid soundID. (Bug #23749)</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06OverseerHandlerScript: sanity check missing for cases where script functions are called without a terminal reference passed in, e.g. during quest initialization. (Bug #23351)</li>
<li>DLC06:DLC06CompanionTrackerScript: sanity check for 'none' actors missing. (Bug #23621)</li>
<li>DLC06:WorkshopAutoRepairScript: fixed an issue that caused massive log spam if the vault workshop DLC was installed at game start because the script tried to access data on WorkshopParentScript before they had been initialized. (Bug #23075)</li>
<li>DN029CannonMasterScript: missing checks for valid sound instances. (Bug #24414)</li>
<li>DN142_FollowerMoveScript: sanity checks missing for empty follower aliases. (Bug #23978)</li>

<li>LoadElevatorPanelScript: 3D check missing. (Bug #24355)</li>
<li>MagazineRackContainerScript: 3D checks missing. (Bug #23856)</li>
<li>MirelurkHarvestableScript: corrected an issue that forced all refs with this script attached into an infinite reset loop because the script called Reset() in the OnReset() event. (#24370)</li>
<li>MQ106InvestgationDummySCRIPT: script property and condition check added to prevent the script from trying to add dead actors and various static objects to the player's inventory. To make this work, script properties had to be updated on the following refs: 00085339, 001342C7, 001342D7, 001342D8, 00137C61, 001476F2, 001476F7, 001476FC, 001476FE, 00147702, 00147704, 00147706, 00147707, 00148233, 0014A136, 00154AB4, 00156937. (Bugs #23756, #24017)</li>
<li>MQ203Script was causing log spam because it performed condition checks in the wrong order. (Bug #24486)</li>
<li>MS02InstallItem: added states to avoid more than one activation of the refs this script is attached to, since any subsequent activation failed with animation graph errors due to the animation sequence played upon activation not being repeatable. (Bug #24493)</li>
<li>OxygenTankScript: missing checks for valid soundID and to prevent it from trying to manipulate disabled references. (Bug #23579)</li>
<li>POISC12_RobotManagerScript: invalid target passed to the RegisterForHitEvent() function. (Bug #24060)</li>
<li>REAliasScript, RECollectionAliasScript: checks added to prevent them from calling functions on REParent script to kill actors that were dead already, since this did fail with an error most of the time. Also corrected a bad 3D check in the KillActor() function of REParent script. (Bug #20583)</li>
<li>REScript: checks added to skip cleanup events received while another cleanup event was being processed already or after the quest was shut down, since handling them could result in quests being restarted by setting the stop stage twice. (Bug #23269)</li>
<li>ShipmentScript: fixed an exploit that allowed to obtain unlimited scrap and made the script functional again since Bethesda had compiled it down to a stub. (Bug #24169)</li>
<li>SimpleElevatorMasterScript: more sanity checks added for missing linked refs because some of the objects controlled by that script are not elevators and thus do not possess all elevator parts. (Bug #24426)</li>
<li>SpotlightTriggerScript: fixed an issue that caused massive log spam because a function that was supposed to return a bool did not return anything due to a badly constructed condition check. (Bug #20876)</li>
<li>SpotlightTriggerScript: missing check for array indices out of range. (Bug #24056)</li>
<li>TrapBarnacle: removed a line that tried to delete a reference that is deleted by the engine already before the script gets to this point. (Bug #22216)</li>
<li>TrapBase: this script was not checking whether a trap was a physical trap before it called the TrapHitBase script which doesn't exist on traps that are not physical traps. (Bug #24220)</li>
<li>TrapGun: 3D checks missing in several places. (Bug #23606)</li>
<li>TrapGun: checks added to prevent the script from giving an XP reward if the gun is grabbed after the trap itself has been disarmed already or after the trap has fired. (Bug #23109)</li>
<li>TrapGun: check added to prevent the script from trying to fire the gun after it was grabbed. (Bug #24485)</li>
<li>TrapRadiationScript: sanity check missing to handle traps with no trigger sound specified. (Bug #24217)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: check added to prevent the script from running on a non-existing reference after the player reloaded a save made in the same area before the trap was triggered. (Bug #23613)</li>
<li>TrapTripwire: 3D check missing for cases where a trap is rearmed by a call from an external script. Also added checks to avoid animation graph errors in the same situation. (Bugs #24058, #24484)</li>
<li>TunnelingRaceFX: checks added to prevent the script from running after the magic effect has expired. (Bug #23289)</li>
<li>WorkshopAttackScript: workshop attacks flagged as night attacks could be delayed for an overly long time because the script did not calculate an appropriate delay. This increased the risk of getting attack messages for two different workshops within a short period of time because the workshop scripts continue to check all workshops for attacks once per game day, irrespective of whether previously triggered attacks have actually started running or not. (Bug #24455)</li>
<li>WorkshopAttackScript, WorkshopParentScript: improved the reset handling for workshops under attack. (Bug #24503)</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: sanity check added to handle rare cases where the script tried to enable a deleted reference because of events firing out of order. (Bug #23755)</li>
<li>WorkshopNPCScript: check added to prevent the script from running on a non-existing actor if the player reloaded a save made before that actor had been created. (Bug #24437)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: sanity checks added to the GetWorkshop() and UpdateActorsWorkObjects_Private() functions to handle cases where an invalid workshopID is passed in. (Bugs #23803, #23948)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: a further modification to the ProduceFood() function was necessary because the current version did not produce anything if WorkshopScript called it on a workshop that was never player owned. Also added a workaround for cases where the total food resource value is not equal to the sum of the individual food resource values, by normalizing the production chance values to the grand total. (Bug #23996)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript counted provisioners as unassigned. They are doing a job though and therefore should count as assigned. (Bug #24261)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: AddActorToWorkshop() called ClearFromOldLocations() only on actors that were tagged as synths, but this function should be called on all in-game created actors. (Bug #24262)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: there was a rare case where the script could assign a boss LocRefType to an actor who was subsequently removed from a workshop. (Bug #24263)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: removed some code from the UnassignActorFromObject() and UnassignActor() functions that was needlessly repeating operations that had been carried out already by previously called sub-functions. (Bug #24264)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: the UnassignObject() function did not properly update an actor's status if some, but not all of his work objects were unassigned. (Bug #24273)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: modified the SetUnassignedPopulationRating() function to accept an actor array, so the ResetWorkhop() function can pass its own actor array and doesn't have to rely on SetUnassignedPopulationRating() to create a new one. Otherwise, the operation would fail if the workshop had unloaded needlessly so because ResetWorkshop already had a valid actor array. (Bug #24274)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: due to inappropriate handling of damaged objects, it was possible that an actor could get more work objects assigned than allowed by his production limit. (Bug #24311)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: To improve performance, the ResetWorkshop() function and the "core functions" that handle actor and object assignment have been completely rewritten. Workshop resets are now 25% faster, on average, which is significant but admittedly only a minor improvement for overly large workshops. The resource assignment procedures however, which run in regular intervals while the player stays at a workshop and also are called every time a resource object is built are more than 90% faster now. This greatly helps in reducing the number of threads that are alive on WorkshopParentScript at the same time and makes script lag issues that could still occur after the reset had finished running less likely. This also required minor modifications to WorkshopScript and WorkshopObjectScript. (Bug #24312)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript assigned beds to robots. (Bug #24408)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: it was possible that workshop resets were queued if the player quickly fast traveled between workshops, and if they eventually started running, they would have run on workshops that were not loaded anymore. A check has been added to the ResetWorkshop() function to skip resets if the workshop they are supposed to run on is not loaded. (Bug #24411)</li>
<li>WorkshopScript, WorkshopParentScript: The location check performed by WorkshopScript before running a resource calculation had to be further improved because a bogus location may be returned for the player's current location if the player is in workshop mode. The improved check has also been applied to a function on WorkshopParentScript that checks whether the most recently visited workshop is still loaded. (Bug #24122)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Settlement & Workshop Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The scrap recipe for certain pieces of wood furniture (workshop_co_ScrapFurnitureWood) erroneously specifies that 20 pieces of wood should be returned when it should only be 2 pieces. (Bug #24257)</li>
<li>Removed actor ownership from all pre-placed beds in settlements because it broke bed assignment by the workshop scripts. This affected Abernathy Farm, Finch Farm, The Slog and Warwick Homestead. (Bug #24531)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Invalid properties cleared from DN035_RobotControlTerminal_SelfDestruct. (Bug #24210)</li>
<li>DN033_Station1Terminal, DN039_SecurityTerminal: Terminals that were supposed to be allowing holotapes to be used but weren’t set to do so. (Bug #24432, Bug #23789)</li>
<li>East City Downs terminal was not configured to allow hacking even though it has linked turrets. (Bug #24230)</li>

<li>0021E02A: bool property on DefaultClearLocationOnTriggerScript set to 'false' to prevent this trigger from disabling itself after the script has run because its enable state is controlled by an enable parent. (Bug #24415</li>
<li>00129AF9: misplaced wall that left gaps on either side of it. Because that wall is in a precomb, another wall piece has been added to close both gaps. (Bug #23705)</li>
<li>00239A20: moved a tire that could end up floating once the road piece it was sitting on got disabled after the Institute had been blown up. (Bug #23829)</li>
<li>0003F2BF: leveled mirelurk with properties missing on AmbushArtFX script. (Bug #23988)</li>

<li>0010784D: removed a script from a Pulowski shelter that conflicted with the PulowskShelterScript and did not work anyway because the linked ref it was relying on did not exist. (Bug #23082)</li>
<li>00182E0E, 00182E0F, 00182E12, 00182E1A, 00182E1D, 00182E1E, 00182E21, 00183262, 0018326C, 00183274, 0018328A, 00183C6D, 00183C6E, 00183C6F, 00183C70, 00183CA0, 00183CA1, 0018F02F: properties modified on AttractionObjectScript to prevent errors from being thrown if the script tries to enable or disable them. (Bugs #23616, #23618)</li>
<li>0003C2FF, 0003C403, 000CAE32, 001322B4, 001E8119, 00204478, 00225E5E, 00225E84, 00225EBB: static objects with a DefaultDisableHavokOnLoad script attached. 001322B4 also had ragdoll data specified. Removed the script and the ragdoll data and also cleared the 'don't havok settle' flag. (Bug #23924)</li>
<li>0014770C, 0014A133: triggers mistakenly enable-parented. (Bug #24015)</li>

<li>0021973A: non-functioning spotlight (no trigger) duplicated in the place of a functioning spotlight. Both spotlights were sharing the same light, resulting in massive log spam. Unlinked the light from the non-functioning spotlight and disabled that spotlight. (Bug #24114)</li>
<li>00196357: unlinked this marker from its enable parent because the quest BoSPrydwenScene_FlightDeck is handling its enable state. (Bug #24127)</li>
<li>00182E34: the ElevatorMasterScript running on this reference failed to start two scenes because the respective script properties were locally flagged as 'removed'. Changed these flags to 'edited'. (Bug #24128)</li>

<li>00160AEC: missing sound property added on DN144DeathclawDustWalkTrigger script. (Bug #24420)</li>

<li>00077CF0, 00077CF6: spotlights missing an owning faction. (Bug #24512)</li>
<li>00075FE9: removed a script from this ref whose only purpose was to enable a linked ref. Because there is no linked ref existing, it only spilled errors. (Bug #24474)</li>

<li>Synth versus Synth (RESceneLC01) [aka Art vs Art] could be repeated infinitely regardless of how the encounter was resolved by the player - even if both Arts were dead. This was due to a tracking variable intended to prevent it from running more than once never being set when the quest terminates. (Bug #22526)</li>
<li>RETravelCT03: It was possible for Gus to be killed by NPCs and the player to be blamed for it happening, which resulted in Kat refusing to talk to the player. Gus is now a protected NPC so that only the player can kill him. (Bug #22521)</li>

<li>In DialogueRailroad, and Lost Soul (RRR09), it's possible for Glory to be spoken of as though she's dead even when she's not. (Bug #22391)</li>
<li>Coursers would tell the player to report suspicous activity to the SRB despite not being inside the Institute at the time. (Bug #22376)</li>
<li>In The Lost Patrol (BoSM01) a scene involving Danse fails to execute due to a bad property setting on the scene data. (Bug #22175)</li>

<li>GenericDoctorsScript: Value used for healing radiation damage was incorrectly being used as an integer instead of a float resulting in leaving fractional rads behind on the target. (Bug #22475)</li>
<li>DLC04:AbPerkGhoulish04EffectScript: Corrected a division by zero error. (Bug #22367)</li>
<li>DLC04:AudioActorPlaySound: Missing 3D check for stopping sound instances. (Bug #22456)</li>
<li>DLC05:DLC05WorkshopElevatorScript: Elevator buttons vanish or end up misplaced and required a new cell load event to correct them when returning to the area. (Bug #20825)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Array index out of range error. (Bug #22514)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Corrections in the ProduceFood() function previously edited by UFO4P 2.0.1. (Bug #22841)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript: Further corrections to fix the failsafe object chosen for random crops. (Bug #22844)</li>
<li>WorkshopParentScript, WorkshopScript: The current workshop tracking variable should now be updated properly when visited, and when the player leaves. (Bug #23016)</li>
<li>WorkshopObjectScript: Initial workshop setup is called twice but does not need to be since it will reset when the player visits for the first time anyway. (Bug #23017)</li>
<li>AttractionObjectScript: Checking the wrong keyword for event processing. (Bug #22817)</li>
<li>MS07bPlayerSitScript: Compiled to a stub. This script was broken and also served no purpose as the quest had been written to do things a different way. (Bug #20971)</li>
<li>WorkshopScript: Bed ownership was not being adjusted when the player took over a settlement with preexisting beds. (Bug #21408)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>

<li>Far Harbor Survivalist (DLC03_FarHarborSurvivalistPerk) was not functional due to being flagged as a spell instead of an ablity. (Bug #22347)</li>
<li>Iron Fist level 5 should properly provide the paralysis effect while wearing power armor. Idle Anim MeleeAttackPerkParalyzingPalm required changing the animation event to point to a normal melee attack animation. Not the most ideal fix, but the loss of one unique animation sequence is less problematic than the perk simply not functioning or causing unrealistic teleportation to the target. (Bug #19673)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.0.1a (2017-06-03)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in the Longfellow escort scene when it determined whether or not to proceed with the Trapper encounter or divert past it because they were already dead. Crash was caused by a freak incident of game data corruption due to fixing an unrelated record in the parent quest. (Bug #22462)</li>

<li>Holotapes should be classified as voice for UI purposes instead of effects. (Bug #21373)</li>
<li>Audio was missing for reloading both the .44 Revolver and Tommy Gun. The animations apparently had the right data but the game lacked sound descriptor records for them. (Bug #20263)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LCharFeralGhoul lacked the proper leveled list calculation flags which resulted in numerous generated encounters with them spawning everything at the highest possible level. This was not intended behavior based on every other leveled list for the same purpose. (Bug #21537)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The ammo for the Thirst Zapper weapon should be removed from the player whenever the gun is dropped, otherwise the player will have an invisible weight reduction of up to 10 units due to the ammo weight. (Bug #21281)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Numerous random events (possibly every single one) were broken and had to be fixed due to the following problems:
 <ul>
  <li>Shutdown stages that attempted to rearm their triggers using aliases which had already been cleared, thus preventing the triggers from resetting.</li>
  <li>Controlling events running on these quests to stop them could not do so because the events they listened for were sent by active triggers. The quests would therefore remain running indefinitely because the triggers were not made active again.</li>
  <li>Affected scripts: REScript, RETriggerScript, REPareentScript</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Removed several NULL pointer properties from The Big Dig (MS16). (Bug #21713)</li>

<li>Invalid NULL properties removed from DLC03DialogueV118. (Bug #21647)</li>
<li>Codsworth was not included in the Vault-Tec DLC companion tracker system. (Bug #21323)</li>
<li>Holt makes a remark about the player wearing a vault suit even when they aren't due to a bad condition check in his dialogue. (Bug #21308)</li>
<li>After completing Confidence Man, Travis Miles does not run his usual random sponsors list. The sponsor list used after completion in RadioDiamondCity had none of the proper random flags set. (Bug #20471)</li>
<li>ActorHello_CIS_Manager prematurely clears aliases when its shutdown stage has processing left to do on those aliases. (Bug #20519)</li>
<li>Random event DLC01REAssaultSC03 incorrectly tries to track target deaths when it doesn't have the supporting quest stages necessary for this. (Bug #21643)</li>
<li>The Radio failsafe quest (DNMasterQuest) did not properly handle certain quest specific radio messages being added or removed from its tracking array, resulting in numerous repeated errors in the logs when trying to process them. (Bug #20484)</li>

<li>Removed invalid properties from REObject_VertibirdKMK03. (Bug #21960)</li>
<li>Removed invalid linked aliases from DLC01RETravelKMK01 & DLC01RETravelKMK02. (Bug #21961)</li>
<li>Priscilla never offers to buy fertilizer from the player because the dialogue incorrectly checks her inventory rather than the player's to see if they have any. (Bug #20144)</li>
<li>RESceneTreasureHuntMaster was referencing the wrong script for casting purposes in the shutdown stage which resulted in the subquests not being terminated properly. (Bug #20758)</li>
<li>Ada drops one of her idle messages about the area calming the player due to an incorrect gender check. (Bug #20473)</li>
<li>Travis Miles never does the news report for rescuing Rex Goodman because the controller scene in RadioDiamondCity was referencing an invalid quest instead of the correct one. (Bug #20472)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>An erroneous script once attached to PlayerPerk has been compiled to a stub to avoid letting it generate endless stack dumps which then impair performance.

<li>COMX688TalkPlayerAliasScript: No validation for NONE locations, which are occasionally valid and need to be accounted for. (Bug #20582)</li>
<li>TrapThistleScript: OnCellDetach() event seems to serve no purpose and throws errors. The reference being looked at is likely deleted by the time it gets here anyway. (Bug #20688)</li>
<li>defaultDismemberOnLoad: No check to prevent processing on disabled references. (Bug #20596)</li>
<li>TrapExplGas: Improperly checking for certain "spells" being held in the right hand using an obsolete method the script comments said should have been culled. (Bug #20674)</li>

<li>Inst307Fight_GantryTargetTriggerScript: Needs sanity check to make sure the virus reference is valid. (Bug #21889)</li>
<li>SentryBotFaceLightScript: No sanity check on animation calls before 3D is loaded. (Bug #21891)</li>

<li>AudioRepeaterActivator: No sanity check for 3D being loaded before playing sound. (Bug #21922)</li>
</ul>

<li>As of this version, the UFO4P is now flagged as an ESM file. Ignore your mod manager if it complains about this. Adjust your load order to place UFO4P directly after the official DLCs if you are not using the official built in mod UI. If you ARE using the official UI, place UFO4P at the very top of your list.</li>
<li>Changes to the way CreateActorPUBLIC is called have been reverted. This will restore full API compatibility for any external callers. A new function specifically for use by WorkshopScript to make Brahmins with has been created. (Bug #21002)</li>
<li>Official Patch 1.7 has corrected all typos for "Nuka Cola" that should be "Nuka-Cola". As a result, all of our corrections for this issue have been removed as they are now ITM records.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Trough water types (IntTroughWater, ExtTroughWater) erroneously had an activation name filled in which caused them to display "MaterialWaterTrough" when trying to fill or drink from them in survival mode. (Bug #20883)</li>
<li>LegendaryModRule_AllowedKeywords_ArmorBodyPartChest is incorrectly allowing more than chest armors to turn legendary due to an incorrectly added ObjectTypeArmor keyword. The erroneous keyword is already in use on legendary armor rules for other body parts. (Bug #20844)</li>
<li>Perfectly Preserved Pie is not correctly flagged as a food item. (Bug #20835)</li>
<li>Due to having a zero duration setting, Cave Fungus, Refreshing Beverage, X-111 Compound, Curie's Healthpak, and Mutant Hound Chops would fail to provide the proper amount of radiation removal in survival mode. (Bug #20737)</li>
<li>Gunner Guard outfits can spawn for NPCs who also use other leg armor which then causes those NPCs to choose to wear their leg armor and nothing else. (Bug #20837)</li>
<li>Nick Valentine will not reequip his original trench coat if the player had given him a different one and then later took it away due to improper flags placed on it. (Bug #20840)</li>
<li>Strong will not reequip his original armor if the player gave him different equipment and later took it back. This is due to his default outfit using the wrong armor entries. (Bug #20841)</li>
<li>Curie will not reequip her original clothing if the player exchanges it for something else due to the wrong versions being used in her default outfit. (Bug #20842)</li>
<li>Roast Yao Guai was incorrectly set to deliver 500% melee damage when the intent was clearly to provide 10%. Though the text indicates a +10 point flat amount, this is not possible to do using food effects so it's pretty clear someone forgot to mark it as +10%. (Bug #19675)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Perk and Stat Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Level 2 of the Basher perk was incorrectly providing a 100% chance to cripple limbs when it should have been 10%. (Bug #20961)</li>

<li>The Idiot Savant perk does not function if your Intelligence drops under 1 due to debuffs or other causes. (Bug #20422)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>

<li>During Taking Independence (Min02) if the player has already cleared the Castle, the quest journal will still indicate you are meeting Preston to plan the attack you already finished. The journal text was attached to the wrong log entry in the quest setup. (Bug #20976)</li>
<li>In The Secret of Cabot House (MS09) if the player kills Lorenzo at Parsons, Jack is never moved back to his house, the Cabots never eventually switch to their "old people" versions, and the final journal entry has the wrong text due to a variable not being set properly when Lorenzo dies. (Bug #20861, Bug #19999)</li>
<li>In The Big Dig (MS16) it was possible to have the game tell you you had looted Hancock's stash even if you convinced Bobbi to leave due to Stage 240 incorrectly containing a "Run on Stop" flag. (Bug #20860) [NR]</li>

<li>WorkshopObjectScript: Crops which are not assigned to a Workshop should not be run through Workshop related updates. (Bug #21028)</li>

<li>WorkshopNPCScript, WorkshopParentScript, LegendaryItemQuestScript: Merged updates from official patch 1.7.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DN135_GwinnettBreweryTerminal2: The "Main Brewery Tours" entry for this terminal duplicated the "Craft Wing Tours" entry that comes before it. This has been fixed by copying the tour info from the other terminal which covers the same topic. (Bug #20878)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Texture & Material Fixes</u></b>

</ul>

<p class="h">v1.0.4c (2016-07-10)</p>
<b><u>UFO4P Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The new argument added to the CreateActorPUBLIC function has been moved to the final position in the function definition to avoid breaking the expected API in future DLC and mods that might be calling it. This also allowed us to drop 2 scripts from the archive that no longer need to be edited as well.</li>
<li>The fixes for the AI pack WorkshopSandboxRelaxation20x4 have been removed as they appear to be greatly aggravating an existing engine bug where settlers spontaneously change physical appearance, gender, race, and lose any items the player has given them. The underlying issue has NOT been fixed by Bethesda but this should mitigate most of the worst effects of it. Settlers will still change clothing on a regular basis, but this is harmless and appears to be an unannounced intentional feature added to the system with Patch 1.6. Settlers who are already bugged will unfortunately retain the bad behavior. It is not known yet if they will eventually return to normal.</li>
<li>Removed the workshop script from Swanson as this prevents the peaceful entry into Covenant for some reason.</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Strong should no longer begin his response dialogue when asked about his relationship status with the player before the player has actually finished speaking. (COMStrongTalk) (Bug #19657)</li>
<li>At the end of Dependency (V81_03), if the player convinced Bobby to get clean, talking to Tina will abort after convincing her to join a settlement due to an unfilled property in the scene that was supposed to bring up the settlement selection window. If you succeeded in convincing her but never got the menu, you will get a pop-up menu upon running the patch which will ask you where you want to send her. (Bug #19581)</li>
<li>When completing Dependency (V81_03) Bobby, Tina, and Rachel do not have their essential status removed because the stage 1000 fragment calls stop too soon and ends up clearing the aliases before the quest is done. (Bug #20142)</li>
<li>Cambridge Polymer Labs (DN015) leaves undroppable quest items in your inventory even if the puzzle quest (DN015Puzzle) to make the armor is completed. DN015 was not stopping DN015Puzzle in stage 100. (Bug #19586)</li>
<li>When negotiating with Deb at Bunker Hill for Traffic Jam (FFBunkerHill02) the rewards given are incorrect due to checking the wrong set of quest stages for the negotiated payment. (Bug #19710)</li>
<li>The Order Up quest (DialogueDrumlinDiner) does not clear aliases for the dead bodies, resulting in them staying in the game forever and respawning their loot. The quest is also not stopped if everyone at the diner has been killed, or if the player aggro'd them all and they're all hostile. (Bug #19720)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Terminal Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Faculty Terminal at Shaw High School (DN020_StaffMemosSubTerminal) is incorrectly named as Principal Tanner's Terminal and incorrectly returns back to Tanner's personal terminal instead of the proper Faculty Terminal main menu. (Bug #19876)</li>
<li>The Dean's Terminal at University Point (DN088_DeansSubTerminalMail) has a mail relay submenu with incorrect dates. It is talking about events from 2077 but is dated 2285, which is incorrect. (Bug #19741)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Texture & Material Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The material swaps for Covert Operations 7 (CustomMaterialSwap001D1FEA) and Covert Operations 8 (CustomMaterialSwap001D1FF1) were switched and caused them to display the wrong artwork when dropped in the world. (Bug #20009)</li>
